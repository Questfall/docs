# Rewards

### Seasons

Each week, 16% of the total weekly issue of QFT goes to the **Seasonal Reward Pool**, and **4.8%** of this will be distributed as a reward to the most dedicated authors.

At the end of a **Season**, accumulated QFT reward is offered to a handful of authors valued by the community and those dedicated to perfecting their craft of quest creation.

The authors who have collected the most author points during the 3-month long season will receive a reward at the end of the season. As the reward accumulates over time, almost 60% of the average weekly token issue is rewarded to the most successful authors.
