# Promotion

Authors can **promote** to their quests by **burning Silver**. The more Silver is burned, the higher the mining points in the quest are, and the more visible and attractive it is to users. 

Promoting quests benefits the author and the miners:
* **More Visibility** – The more Silver is burned for promoting a quest the higher it will appear on the quest feed. This results in more users seeing and completing the quest.
* **Reward for Miners** – The mining point reward of a quest increases as more Silver is used for promoting it. This makes the quest more attractive to miners which leads to more completions and higher ratings.
* **Author Reward** - As the weekly QFT reward for authors is calculated based on the amount of completions on the author’s quests, promoting quests directly contributes for a higher weekly reward.

There will be no upper limit to the number of Silver an author can burn, as the maximum Reputation 10 will be an unreachable limit.

### Reputation as Multiplier

The author’s reputation works as a **multiplier** for the promotional weight of the burned silver. The higher the reputation the less Silver needs to be burned for reaching the same promotional potential. To increase the reputation the authors are motivated to create high-quality quests valued by the community.

Each Author starts with the author's reputation of 1. This means that the Silver cost ratio for promotion is 1/1, if you burn 100 silver its effect on promotion is 100 promotional points. As the author’s reputation gets higher the multiplier increases and real promotional cost decreases, for example, if the author's reputation is 5, 100 silver results in 500 promotional points.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Silver effect on promotion is calculated by the formula **x * y = k**
Where 
**x** - Amount of mining points (equal to 100)\
**y** - Amount of silver spent\
**k** - arbitrary ratio we can adjust\
{% endhint %}

The author’s reputation stays in 1 until there are enough completions on the author’s quests. On the launch of Questfall, the author must reach 10k completions to have their reputation adjusted. This number will increase with the platform's growth as it is automatically adjusted by the active weighted votes given by users throughout the week.
