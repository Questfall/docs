# Promotion

Authors can **promote** their quests by burning Silver. The more Silver is burned, the higher the base reward of a quest is, and the more visible and attractive it is to users. 

**Silver** can be acquired through **Moderation** or by buying it with **Gold**. 

By burning Gold the user receives 10 times the amount of Silver. For example, If 100 Gold is burned the user receives 1000 Silver.

{% hint style="info" %}
For convenience, the users can use Gold directly for promotion so that the burning of it to Silver happens automatically.

### Promotion Benefits

Promoting quests benefits the author, miners, and the whole system:
* **More Visibility** – The more Silver is burned for promoting a quest the higher it will appear on the quest feed. This results in more users seeing and completing the quest.
* **Reward for Miners** – The mining point reward of a quest increases as more Silver is used for promoting it. This makes the quest more attractive to miners which leads to more completions and higher ratings.
* **Author Reward** - As the weekly QFT reward for authors is calculated based on the amount of completions on the author’s quests, promoting quests directly contributes for a higher weekly reward.
* **QFT Burning** – Quests promotion contributes to deflation within the system as QFT is constantly burned for Gold, and then converted to Silver for quest promotion.

### Reputation as Multiplier

The **Author’s Reputation** works as a **Multiplier** for the promotional weight of the burned Silver. The higher the reputation the less Silver needs to be burned for reaching the same promotional potential. To increase the reputation the authors are motivated to create high-quality quests valued by the community.

Each Author starts with the reputation of 1. This means that the Silver cost ratio for promotion is 1/1, if you burn 1000 Silver its effect on promotion is 1000 points. As the author’s reputation gets higher the multiplier increases and real promotional cost decreases, for example, if the author's reputation is 5, 1000 silver results in 5000 points.

The author’s reputation stays in 1 until there are enough completions on the author’s quests. On the launch of Questfall, the author must reach 10k weighed votes to have their reputation adjusted. This number will increase with the platform's growth as it is automatically adjusted by the accepted votes given by users throughout the week.

### Cost of Promotion

The author can choose the amount of Silver they want to burn to promote their quest. Each quest has a minimum promotional amount of 1000 Silver to prevent system abuse. There is no upper limit to how much Silver can be burned for promotion. 

The author can choose the uptime for a quest from 1 to 30 days. The longer the duration of a quest the higher the total cost of the promotion. However, each subsequent day of the promotion becomes cheaper by 10%, so the longer the promotions the better the price for a single day of promotional time. 

The position of the promoted quest on the global quest feed is based on the base mining points in a quest resulting from the amount of burned Silver. The higher the base mining points of a quest the higher it will be on the global quest feed and the more mining points users receive as a reward by completing the quest. The duration of a quest does not affect the quests position in the quest feed.

Within the promotion, the author can see the amount of the mining point reward within the quest and what placement in the global quest feed they will have with a chosen quest duration and burned Silver amount. 

There will be no upper limit to the number of Silver an author can burn, as the maximum base mining point reward of 1000 will be an unreachable limit.

This formula is used to calculate the initial price of mining points in Silver. This amount is then adjusted with the author's reputation multiplier to get the real Silver price of mining points for each user. 

 **x * y = k**
* **x** - Amount of mining points (equal to 1000)
* **y** - Amount of Silver spent
* **k** - ?
