# Promotion

Authors can add mining points to their quests by burning Silver. The more Silver is burned, the higher the mining points in the quest are, and the more visible and attractive it is to users. 

There will be no upper limit to the number of Silver an author can burn, as the maximum Reputation 10 will be an unreachable limit.
