# Ratings

The quality of the author's quest is reflected in the **rating** users give to it. 

To finalize the completion of a quest, each user must rate the quest from 1-10. 
The ratings on a quest will directly impact the author's **reputation score**. 

To prevent users from making multiple accounts spamming high ratings on a self-made low-value quest, a certain number of votes and vote weight are needed for the voting to be valid.

### Average Rating

**IMAGE OF AVERAGE RATING CURVE**

To encourage the giving of fair ratings on a quest and to prevent rating manipulation, the user is incentivized to vote close to the **average rating**. Users gain or lose a small % of mining efficiency based on how close one voted to the average of all votes. If the user votes on the neutral zone the mining efficiency stays unchanged. The closer the user votes for the average, the more mining efficiency one gains, and the farther, the likelier it is to get the maximum mining efficiency penalty.

{% hint style="info" %}
With each quest voting the user can gain or lose up to 0.2% of mining efficiency.
{% endhint %}

The maximum mining efficiency bonus user can reach by voting is limited based on the level. With each level, the potential maximum mining efficiency bonus increases by 0.1%. Regardless of the level, there is no limit to the negative mining efficiency one can have by voting continuously out of the average.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, level 40 users can have a maximum +4% mining efficiency bonus from voting.
{% endhint %}
