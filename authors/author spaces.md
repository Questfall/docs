# Author Spaces

IMAGE OF AUTHOR SPACE

**Author Space** is the profile and workspace for the individual author or project. So for the author to be able to start to create quests, first they need to set up their author space. 

Within the author space, users can manage all the necessary things related to authors like creating quests, reviewing submitted answers, seeing the stats, or claiming earned author rewards. Also, it works like a profile page on social media platforms so here users can find the author's quests, follow him and know all the relevant information about the author.

{% hint style="info" %}
A user can be the creator of only one author space but can be part of an unlimited amount by invitation. Like when a team or company wants to manage its official Questfall author space, many users can have the rights to use it and create quests for it.
{% endhint %}

The owner of the author's space can give two types of roles to other users for managing the space:
1. **Owner** – Has full access and rights to the author space.
2. **Admin** – Has limited access to the author space. The owners can modify the rights of admins for example by allowing them only to edit and publish quests they have created.

### Quest Creation

IMAGE OF QUEST CREATION FORM 1 & 2

Within the author's space users can create and publish quests. 
The creation of a new quest is a two-part process:

1. First users fill in all the relevant information about the quest like cover image, instructions, and submission types, and then save it as a draft.
2. This draft can be deployed after the user has chosen the duration of the quest and the amount of Silver to burn for promotion.

{% hint style="info" %}
Authors need to carefully check all the information in the quest as after publishing it can no longer be edited.
{% endhint %}

###  Quest Sorting

Within the author space, all the created quests are sorted in four ways:

* **Drafts** – Quests that users of author space have completed as drafts but haven’t published. Every new quest is first saved as a draft.
* **Active** – Published quests that haven’t ended or reported. Here the author can see the remaining duration of published quests.
* **Reported** – All the quests published by the author space that have been reported. The falsely reported and those removed from the quest feed can be found in this section.
* **Ended** – Quests that have ended. Here the author can find all the accepted submitted answers on his quests.

### Special Rewards

Through promotion, the author can increase the base reward of their quests to make them more appealing to users. Additionally, authors can set a **Special Reward** of QFT or Gold for those users who mine the most points exclusively with the author's quests. 

The special reward can attract users to compete for the rewards resulting in many completions on the author's quests. 

For this purpose, each author space has a leaderboard showing the users who have gained the most mining points from the author's quests on a reward period.

### Silver Donations

Each author space has a QFT, Gold, and Silver balances that can be used for special rewards and to promote the created quests. The owners can freely deposit any amount of these assets to the author's space. 

QFT and Gold can be withdrawn but Silver can be only used within the author space. 

Other users can **Donate** assets to the author space to increase the Silver balance. The donation allows project members and common users to support the space. Donated QFTs and Gold are immediately burned to Silver.

{% hint style="info" %}
Personal resources can be used directly for promotion by the quest creator without manually moving the assets to the author space first.
{% endhint %}

### Banner Promotion

Within the Questfall platform, two **Marketing Banners** are visible for all users – one for the team to promote collaborations, and another for author spaces to promote themselves. Promoting the author space this way can make it known to the community and increase the number of followers and quest completions.

Author spaces can buy with Silver or Gold a one-day slot for featuring them on the banner. There are available slots on sale only for the next 30 days.

The prices of the one-day slots increase exponentially the farther we go from the current day. This guarantees there are always author spaces willing to pay the price for featuring as the price for the current day is so low.

As the demand for banner promotion grows, the author spaces are willing to pay more and buy days further in the future to make sure to get a spot. There is no limitation to how many one-day spots a single author space can buy.

To ensure no inappropriate author spaces are promoted users above a certain level can report the banner. Reported banners are voted by the moderators and rewarded in the same way as [Reported Quests](../mining/Quests.md).
