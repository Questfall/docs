# Author Spaces

**Author Space** is the profile and workspace for the individual author or project. So for the author to be able to start to create quests, first they need to set up their author space. 

Within the author space, users can manage all the necessary things related to authors like creating quests, reviewing submitted answers, seeing the stats, or claiming earned author rewards. Also, it works like a profile page on social media platforms so here users can find the author's quests, follow him and know all the relevant information about the author.

{% hint style="info" %}
A user can be the creator of only one author space but can be part of an unlimited amount by invitation. Like when a team or company wants to manage its official Questfall author space, many users can have the rights to manage it and create quests for it.
