# Author Spaces

**Author Space** is the profile and workspace for the individual author or project. So for the author to be able to start to create quests, first they need to set up their author space. 

Within the author space, users can manage all the necessary things related to authors like creating quests, reviewing submitted answers, seeing the stats, or claiming earned author rewards. Also, it works like a profile page on social media platforms so here users can find the author's quests, follow him and know all the relevant information about the author.

{% hint style="info" %}
A user can be the creator of only one author space but can be part of an unlimited amount by invitation. Like when a team or company wants to manage its official Questfall author space, many users can have the rights to manage it and create quests for it.

### Quest Creation

IMAGE OF QUEST CREATION FORM

Within the author's space users can create and publish quests. 
The creation of a new quest is a two-part process:

1. First users fill in all the relevant information about the quest like cover image, instructions, and submission types, and then save it as a draft.
2. This draft can be deployed after the user has chosen the duration of the quest and the amount of Silver to burn for promotion.

### Special Rewards

Through promotion, the author can increase the base reward of their quests to make them more appealing to users. Additionally, authors can set a special reward for those users who mine the most points exclusively with the author's quests. 

The special reward can attract users to compete for the rewards resulting in many completions on the author's quests. 

For this purpose, each author space has a leaderboard showing the users who have gained the most mining points from the author's quests on a reward period.
