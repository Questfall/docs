# Author Spaces

**Author Space** is the profile and user interface for the individual author or project. So for the author to be able to start to create quests, first they need to set up their author space. 

A user can be the creator of only one author space but can be part of an unlimited amount by invitation. Like when a team or company wants to manage its official Questfall author space, many users can have the rights to manage it and create quests for it.

The author space works as a profile page for the author. This is like a profile page on social media platforms where users can find the author's quests, follow him, know the basic information about the author, and see his linked social media accounts.
