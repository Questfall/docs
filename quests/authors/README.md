# Quest Creation (10%)

Existing quest platforms require authors to spend resources on user rewards. In contrast, Questfall rewards users for completing quests on behalf of the system. Even better, authors are rewarded with 10% of the weekly [QFT](../../assets/qft.md) issue for creating popular quests.

This creates a new authoring paradigm that coexists with the traditional one - while some project teams can still use money to promote their quests to the Questfall audience, other authors can earn from their creativity without any investment.

In Questfall, authors can create quests with any tasks that do not break the rules, but the system must ensure that users have actually performed the required quest actions to keep mining fair. Therefore, there are several predefined types of quests, each with its own way of completion that ensures the system can properly validate them.

{% hint style="info" %}
New quest types will be implemented as Questfall evolves.
{% endhint %}

The first group of quests have the same correct answers for everyone and can therefore be validated instantly by the system without community moderation. Validating the completion of these quests is inexpensive in terms of system load, so the system allows multiple attempts to complete them.

* **Text** - a user must enter text that is evaluated against one or more predefined correct answers.
* **Quiz** - a user has to choose between several options, one of which is secretly the correct one.
* **Survey** - a user must select one of the options, each of which is considered correct.

The second group requires [community moderation](../moderators/) for each completion and therefore only allows one attempt to complete the quest, as such an approach places a heavy load on the system in terms of moderator work.

* **Action** - a user must perform an action on a third-party platform and provide a link and screenshot for moderation.
* **Transaction** - a user must provide a link and screenshot of a specific transaction in the given blockchain.

The number of users who complete a quest is directly affected by its position in the [Quest Feed](../../overview/global-feed.md), which is ordered by the quest's reward. In other words, to make a popular quest, an author should set a relatively high [Quest Bounty](quest-bounty.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Of course, the reward is not the only factor people rely on when choosing a quest to complete - a high Bounty just ensures that people will notice the quest.
{% endhint %}

As a result, authors compete with each other for users' attention through the Quest Bounty, which can only be set by burning [Silver](../../assets/silver.md). To provide room for author competition while keeping the Bounty capped, the Silver price of each Bounty point increases exponentially.

Since Silver can be earned by participating in community moderation, authors are not forced to spend money to promote their quests.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
To support talented and dedicated creators who create quests that the community values, they will receive up to a 90% discount, depending on their [Karma](karma.md), when paying for the Quest Bounty.
{% endhint %}

Therefore, in order to make a quest popular, which will allow project teams to attract new users or creators to earn, authors should burn Silver, which can only be acquired through QFT burning or through proper moderation, both of which add value to the community.

In addition, to be successful in the long run, an author should create quests that are highly rated by the community, thus earning Karma, which gives a huge boost to the promotion of subsequent quests.
