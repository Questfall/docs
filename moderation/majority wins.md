# Majority Wins

One of the unique features of Questfall is its completely
decentralized moderation which allows the community to decide the
validity of quest completions and reports. This system allows
anyone to participate in moderation and by design is still
protected from abuse.

Moderating provides users with the **energy** that is needed for
**leveling (XP)** and **quest promotion**. As moderation is the
primary and only free source of energy there will always be enough users willing to do it.

The moderation voting is designed in a way that it rewards real
users and penalizes those trying to abuse or automate the system.

### Binary Voting

The System uses a **binary voting** - each item moderated is voted on using the binary options **yes/no**. The votes have different weights and a winning majority is calculated based on the vote weights. 

Users who voted with the majority are rewarded with energy and
those who voted with the minority lose or do not get energy.

The **weight** of a user's vote is directly correlated to his level. This makes it impossible for many new accounts to be registered and used to manipulate voting results.

{% hint style="info" %}
high-level users, who are most interested in the platform's stability and success, have a great deal of influence in moderation.
