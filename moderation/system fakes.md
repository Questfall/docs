# System Fakes

Users can't choose specific items to vote on when moderating - the **system assigns them randomly.** This prevents the same automated vote from being cast
from many accounts.

The system keeps a balance by providing users with different types of moderation and an equal amount of right/wrong answers and a moderation can be bypassed only by spending energy. 

Along with the real problems that need moderation system generates **fakes**, that should not pass moderation.

Since the system knows what should be the correct vote it can
punish malicious voters and reward good ones independent of who is the majority. In other words, such fakes are used as honeypots.

{% hint style="info" %}
In fake moderation, the quest information is mixed in such a way
that humans can recognize it being a non-valid completion but bots
can’t. 
{% endhint %}

Fake quests allow the system to keep a 50/50 balance between right
and wrong answers so the user can’t succeed by accepting every
moderation.
