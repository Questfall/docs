# Voting Principles

The moderation voting is designed in a way that it rewards real
users and penalizes those trying to abuse or automate the system.

The following principles apply to the moderation voting:

* **Vote weight** - The weight of a user's vote is directly
correlated to his level. This makes it impossible for many new
accounts to be registered and used to manipulate voting results.

This means that high-level users, who are most interested in the
platform's stability and success, have a great deal of influence in
moderation.

* **Binary voting** - Each item moderated is voted on using the
binary options yes/no. The votes have different weights and a
winning majority is calculated based on the vote weights. 

Users who voted with the majority are rewarded with energy and
those who voted with the minority lose or do not get energy. 

* **Reward balance** - Guessing the right answers is a losing
strategy as the average penalty for wrong answers is double the
reward for the right answers.

Energy rewards is different for each type of moderation when voting
with majority or minority.
Witness: +10/0 | Approve: 0/-20 | reported quests +10/-20 (also for
the reporter)
{% endhint %}

The user receives the reward or punishment when the moderation is
fully settled.

* **Randomly assigned moderations** - Users can't choose specific
items to vote on when moderating - the system assigns them
randomly. This prevents the same automated vote from being cast
from many accounts.

Specific moderation can be bypassed only by spending energy. 

The system keeps a balance by providing users with different types
of moderation and an equal amount of right/wrong answers.

* **Fake moderations** - Along with the real problems that need
moderation system generates fakes, that should not pass moderation.
Since the system knows what should be the correct vote it can
punish malicious voters and reward good ones independent of who is
the majority. In other words, such fakes are used as honeypots.

{% hint style="info" %}
In fake moderation, the quest information is mixed in such a way
that humans can recognize it being a non-valid completion but bots
can’t. 
{% endhint %}

Fake quests allow the system to keep a 50/50 balance between right
and wrong answers so the user can’t succeed by accepting every
moderation.
