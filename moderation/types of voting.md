# Types of Voting

There are **three types of moderation** in the system.

### Witnessing

Users vote if the link content is equal to the
screenshot provided by the user completing the quest.

This is the first step of making sure the quest completion is
valid. Witnessing is needed to make sure that there is unchangeable information to vote for in the approving state. 

### Approving

Users vote if the quest is done correctly.

Based on the completion terms and extra information provided by the author moderators vote if the quest should be accepted or declined.

### Reported Quests or Completions

Users vote if the reported quest or completion breaks community rules.

Reported quests or completions go to moderation only if there are enough reports in it. The reporters either win or lose silver based on the moderation voting result. If a reported quest or completion is voted to be against the community rules the user responsible for it gets a high penalty.
