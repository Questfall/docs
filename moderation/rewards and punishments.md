# Rewards and Punishments


**Silver Reward** for voting with or against the majority is unique for each type of moderation:

* Witness +10/0 
* Approve 0/-20  
* Reported Quests: +10/-20  (also for the reporter)

The user receives the reward or punishment when the moderation is
fully settled. Usually this takes from hours up to days. 

As the system assignes moderations randomly in re-defined portions, each user must moderate all types. Guessing the right answers is a losing strategy as the average penalty for wrong answers is double the reward for the right answers.
