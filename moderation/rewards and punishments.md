# Rewards and Punishments

Moderation is the primary and only free source of **Silver** which is needed for XP and quest promotion. 

The Silver Reward for voting with or against the majority is unique for each type of moderation:

* Witness +10/0 
* Approve 0/-20  
* Reported Quests +10/-20  (also for the reporter)

As the system assignes moderations randomly in re-defined portions, each user must moderate all types. To increase the Silver count, the user must be able to vote with the majority on all different types of moderation. Guessing the right answers is a losing strategy as the average penalty for wrong answers is double the reward for the right answers. 

The user receives the reward or punishment when the moderation is fully settled. Usually this takes from hours up to days.
