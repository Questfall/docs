# ðŸ“Œ Introduction

Bitcoin introduced the concept of mining, but brute forcing the hash in the Proof of Work consensus brings no value to the world other than protecting the Bitcoin blockchain from [Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack).

Over the past few years, our team has been working hard on [the Elysium blockchain](https://docs.elysium-chain.com/en), which was born out of the idea of quest mining. We dream of a blockchain where people earn cryptocurrency by completing quests and can level up to increase their mining power, like in role-playing games.

This approach creates a hierarchy of users, which is essentially a defence against Sybil attacks. In Bitcoin, for example, the defence is implemented with a hierarchy of users based on their computing power.

As our team worked on the details of such a quest mining approach, at a certain point we realized that it could be implemented as a standalone project to test and tweak the mechanics before integrating it into the core of the Elysium blockchain.

Quest mining designed specifically for blockchain, when applied in a more specific way, can take a quest platform to an unreachable level. After all, existing solutions have significant weaknesses, the most important of which are the lack of Sybil protection and poor tokenomics. The result is an overwhelming number of bots and uncertain rewards for users who do quests.&#x20;

We had first-hand experience of bot and multi-account flooding on a popular quest platform when we tried to assemble a decentralized group of real people as a pool of initial validators for Elysium.

Thus, Questfall is a big practical step towards Elysium, with its own value, as it is intended to be the first questing platform without bots and multi-accounts, where people can actually earn money by doing meaningful quests.
