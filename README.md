# ‚ùï About the project

Though quest platforms become more and more popular these days the new approach to people's interaction through quests is not settled down yet. All the teams are developing their vision not really knowing how it should work. That is why existing solutions has major drawbacks.

First, there are too many bots and multi-accounts on such platforms because there is no built-in solid Sybil attach defense. Second, there should be global rewards from the system for the quest activity, since the value of opinioned rewards by particular projects are not guaranteed.

For the last couple of years our Team has been working hard on the [Elysium blockchain](https://docs.elysium-chain.com/) and we have developed solid solutions for the Sybil attack defense and Tokenomics. Before implementing these solutions in the blockchain we are keen to test them on a simpler project. But Questfall is not just a random idea for testing, in fact it is a core of the future blockchain.

Thus, having solid theoretical models that were developed for the blockchain and having a huge practical experience of using existing quests platforms our Team really knows how to implement the perfect quest system. To achieve that the core of the Questfall platform will be built using the fallowing principals and concepts.

## Core concepts

#### Deflationary mining

Deflationary mining concept (the article will follow) assumes that users who add value to the system are periodically rewarded with respect to their contribution (during the period) by the issuance of the token with the limited total supply. This way such users are considered miners, and it is assumed that tokens could be obtained through mining only. To add to such a mining deflationary flavor there should be a way to burn tokens for some valuable product of the system.

In relation to Questfall project this concept applies as such:

* Questfall Token (QFT) total supply is 10 000 000. This supply is issued weekly by decreasing portions. The amount of QFT that will be issued any particular week could be calculated by the formula. There is no pre-minting of the QFT, which means that the only way to obtain newly issued QFT is through mining. This also means that QFT can be obtained as a reward for certain valuable actions without having to buy it.

* QFTs issued each week are distributed with respect to contribution to those who has brought value to the system during the week.&#x20;

* By burning QFT any author can obtain off-chain system Credits (at a fixed USD price), which can be used for the quest promotion to the platform users.

#### Sybil attack defense

To prevent bots and multi-accounts there will be used two approaches in Questfall: user stakes and user levels. Since the amount of QFT that is distributed each week to miners is fixed, the users will compete with each other for the share they receive. The basis of the miner's&#x20;
