# âœ¨ Introduction

Over the past few years, our team has been working hard on the [Elysium blockchain](https://docs.elysium-chain.com/en), which was born out of the idea of quest mining, meaning that users can mine cryptocurrency by creating or completing quests. Instead of hash power in the Proof of Work consensus, a user earns quest power through quest activity, and the reward is distributed according to the quest power of all users (as in mining pools).

This approach implies defending against Sybil attacks before users do quests. Taking such a defense out of consensus not only allows new types of faster and more efficient consensuses to be created (like [Proof of Victory](https://docs.elysium-chain.com/en/elysium/proof-of-victory)), but also implies that value is added to the world while mining.

Questfall is a big practical step towards Elysium, as it implements two key social mechanics, we've developed for the blockchain: quest mining and deflationary tokenomics. And in the future, Questfall may become the core of the Elysium blockchain.

But more importantly, in the short term, these concepts will help us achieve our main goal of making Questfall the first quest platform without bots and multi-accounts, where people can actually earn money by doing really interesting quests.
