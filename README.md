  Questfall is an innovative quest platform that originated from our work on the
  Elysium blockchain.

# ‚ùï - About the project

Over the past few years, our team has been working hard on the Elysium blockchain, which, like any other blockchain, is a complex system involving not only code, but also human interaction, implying various psychological aspects. This inseparable combination of social and technological factors makes blockchain, according to many experts, one of the most complex IT systems in the world.

The social aspect of any blockchain consists of tokenomics and consensus. However, upon closer examination, it appears that the canonical Proof of Work consensus includes the Sybil defence. In Elysium, we have successfully decoupled the Sybil defence from the consensus through the use of RPG user levels. The idea is that users can level up by completing quests.

Testing and fine-tuning blockchain code after it has been deployed is challenging due to the need for nodes to communicate using the same protocol. In many cases, significant changes to blockchain result in a hard fork because the new version of node software cannot communicate with the previous one. The Questfall project was initiated to test the functionality of social parts, including tokenomics, RPG levels and quests, in a real-world setting.

Another reason to develop Questfall is that all existing quest platforms have significant weaknesses, the most crucial of which are the lack of a Sybil defence and poor tokenomics. This results in an overwhelming number of bots and uncertain rewards for users who do quests. We have first-hand experience of this, having tried to assemble a decentralised group of real people as a pool of initial validators for Elysium.

We believe that the only way to achieve a perfect quest platform, by solving all the issues is to treat Questfall as a complex social and technology system (similar to blockchain) rather than just as a quest-centric online service. This is what Questfall is all about: it is like blockchain, only a quest platform.

While quest platforms are gaining popularity, a standardized approach to user interaction through quests is yet to be established. All the teams are developing their vision not really knowing how it should work. That is why existing solutions has major drawbacks.

First, there are too many bots and multi-accounts on such platforms because there is no built-in solid Sybil attach defense. Second, there should be global rewards from the system for the quest activity, since the value of opinioned rewards by particular projects are not guaranteed.

For the last couple of years our Team has been working hard on the [Elysium blockchain](https://docs.elysium-chain.com/) and we have developed solid solutions for the Sybil attack defense and Tokenomics. Before implementing these solutions in the blockchain we are keen to test them on a simpler project. But Questfall is not just a random idea for testing, in fact it is a core of the future blockchain.

Thus, having solid theoretical models that were developed for the blockchain and having a huge practical experience of using existing quests platforms our Team really knows how to implement the perfect quest system. To achieve that the core of the Questfall platform will be built using the fallowing principals and concepts.

## Core concepts

#### Deflationary mining

Deflationary mining concept (the article will follow) assumes that users who add value to the system are periodically rewarded with respect to their contribution (during the period) by the issuance of the token with the limited total supply. This way such users are considered miners, and it is assumed that tokens could be obtained through mining only. To add to such a mining deflationary flavor there should be a way to burn tokens for some valuable product of the system.

In relation to Questfall project this concept applies as such:

* Questfall Token (QFT) total supply is 10 000 000, which is issued weekly by decreasing portions. The amount of QFT that will be issued any particular week could be calculated by the formula. There is no pre-minting of the QFT, which means that the only way to obtain newly issued QFT is through mining.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

* QFTs issued each week are distributed with respect to contribution to those who has brought value to the system during the week. This means that QFT can be obtained as a reward for certain valuable actions without having to buy it.

{% endhint %}

* By burning QFT any author can obtain off-chain system Credits (at a fixed USD price), which can be used for the quest promotion to the platform users. This means that after some market saturation period the circulating supply of QFT will steadily decline.

{% endhint %}

#### Sybil attack defense

To prevent bots and multi-accounts there will be used two approaches in Questfall: user stakes and user levels. Since the amount of QFT that is distributed each week to miners is fixed, the users will compete with each other for the share they receive. This miners' competition will force users to use any opportunity to gain any advantage.

Thus, having bigger stake or getting higher RPG level will allow users to obtain advantage over others, which also makes bots and several accounts usage less profitable than focusing only on one account.

## Additional features

#### Author motivation for quality quests

Most projects on the existing quest platform do not put a lot of resources in the quest creation, and the majority of quests are dumb tasks to join Discord or repost a Tweet. But this is not how things should be!

On Questfall all the quests will have a rating which will be considered as a mining power for calculating rewards for authors for the quests they have created. And the more public will appreciate the quest the higher will be the reward for its author.&#x20;

This approach will allow authors to receive a reward for publishing their books, articles, lessons, music, images, videos and so on. Quests like "Read a new chapter of my book and answer a question" could become a new paradigm to earn by creating intellectual products in the modern economy.

#### Nonbinary quest completion

Some quest completions are binary: either completed or not. But some quests assume deferent quality or quantity of completions, for example a drawing contest or a task to swap one token for another.

On Questfall this kind of nonbinary quests (contests) will be first-class citizens. When such a quest is finished the leaderboard will be formed and the users will be rewarded according to their places and the formula set by the author.

#### Quests applied to the real world

When rewards are global the users are paid by the system and not by projects or other users. This means that anyone has a tool to make a world a better place. For example, our Team will create the ongoing quest "Plant a tree" from very beginning.&#x20;

Moreover, global rewards and nonbinary quests will allow to order any intellectual work such as illustrations, animations, videos, music, design, code and so on.

In addition to this, we will implement in the future versions of Questfall local quests, which will allow to find a needed worker (such as babysitter, maid, builder, gardener, pool cleaner, etc...) for your task near you.

#### Global quest feed and quest promotion

The quest platform is not that different from the any social media like Facebook or Tweeter. The only difference is the depth of the user reaction to the post. If social media format assumes only emoji reactions to the post, a quest will need some proof of its completion (that the user has taken demanded action).

That is why the global quest feed is the straightforward analogous of the post feed in any social media. This approach not only allows a user to be in the trend of what is happening on the platform, but it also allows projects to promote their quests to the public by burning some QFT.

#### Crowd-based validation of quest completions

Our Team has created many quests on different popular platforms, and we always wanted to push the answers checking to somebody else. In Questfall any author will be able to let the miners (common users) verify the completions of the quest.

This will not only allow miners to earn, but it will also solve any possible automation problem. For example, the cost of Tweeter API is very overpriced, but users can see a particular post for free. So, for author there will be no difference between if the server checked the action on Tweeter or the crowd.
