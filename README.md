# ‚ùï About the project

Though quest platforms become more and more popular these days the new approach to people's interaction through quests is not settled down yet. All the teams are developing their vision not really knowing how it should work. That is why existing solutions has major drawbacks.

First, there are too many bots and multi-accounts on such platforms because there is no built-in solid Sybil attach defense. Second, there should be global rewards from the system for the quest activity, since the value of opinioned rewards by particular projects are not guaranteed.

For the last couple of years our Team has been working hard on the [Elysium blockchain](https://docs.elysium-chain.com/) and we have developed solid solutions for the Sybil attack defense and Tokenomics. Before implementing these solutions in the blockchain we are keen to test them on a simpler project. But Questfall is not just a random idea for testing, in fact it is a core of the future blockchain.

Thus, having solid theoretical models that were developed for the blockchain and having a huge practical experience of using existing quests platforms our Team really knows how to implement the perfect quest system. To achieve that the core of the Questfall platform will be built using the fallowing principals and concepts.

## Core concepts

#### Deflationary mining

Deflationary mining concept (the article will follow) assumes that users who add value to the system are periodically rewarded with respect to their contribution (during the period) by the issuance of the token with the limited total supply. This way such users are considered miners, and it is assumed that tokens could be obtained through mining only. To add to such a mining deflationary flavor there should be a way to burn tokens for some valuable product of the system.

In relation to Questfall project this concept applies as such:

* Questfall Token (QFT) total supply is 10 000 000, which is issued weekly by decreasing portions. The amount of QFT that will be issued any particular week could be calculated by the formula. There is no pre-minting of the QFT, which means that the only way to obtain newly issued QFT is through mining.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

* QFTs issued each week are distributed with respect to contribution to those who has brought value to the system during the week. This means that QFT can be obtained as a reward for certain valuable actions without having to buy it.

* By burning QFT any author can obtain off-chain system Credits (at a fixed USD price), which can be used for the quest promotion to the platform users. This means that after some market saturation period the circulating supply of QFT will steadily decline.

{% endhint %}

#### Sybil attack defense

To prevent bots and multi-accounts there will be used two approaches in Questfall: user stakes and user levels. Since the amount of QFT that is distributed each week to miners is fixed, the users will compete with each other for the share they receive. This miners' competition will force users to use any opportunity to gain any advantage.

Thus, having bigger stake or getting higher RPG level will allow users to obtain advantage over others, which also makes bots and several accounts usage less profitable than focusing only on one account.

## Additional features

#### Author motivation for quality quests

Most projects on the existing quest platform do not put a lot of resources in the quest creation, and the majority of quests are dumb tasks to join Discord or repost a Tweet. But this is not how things should be!

On Questfall all the quests will have a rating which will be considered as a mining power for calculating rewards for authors for the quests they have created. And the more public will appreciate the quest the higher will be the reward for its author.&#x20;

This approach will allow authors to receive a reward for publishing their books, articles, lessons, music, images, videos and so on. Quests like "Read a new chapter of my book and answer a question" could become a new paradigm to earn by creating intellectual products in the modern economy.

#### Quests applied to the real world



#### Nonbinary quest completion



#### Global quest feed and quest promotion

The quest platform is not that different from the any social media like Facebook or Tweeter. The only difference is the depth of the user reaction to the post. If social media format assumes only emoji reactions to the post, a quest will need some proof of its completion (that the user has taken demanded action).

That is why the global quest feed is the straightforward analogous of the post feed in any social media. This approach not only allows a user to be in the trend of what is happening on the platform, but it also allows projects to promote their quests to the public by burning some QFT.

#### Crowd-based validation of quest completions

Our Team has created many quests on different popular platforms, and we always wanted to push the answers checking to somebody else. In Questfall any author will be able to let the miners (common users) verify the completions of the quest.

This will not only allow miners to earn, but it will also solve any possible automation problem. For example, the cost of Tweeter API is very overpriced, but users can see a particular post for free. So, for author there will be no difference between if the server checked the action on Tweeter or the crowd.
