# âœ¨ Introduction

Bitcoin introduced the concept of mining, but brute forcing the hash in the Proof of Work consensus brings no value to the world other than protecting the Bitcoin blockchain from Sybil attacks.

Over the past few years, our team has been working hard on [the Elysium blockchain](https://docs.elysium-chain.com/en), which was born out of the idea of quest mining. We dream of a blockchain where people earn cryptocurrency by doing quests that increase their level (like in RPGs), which acts as a defense against Sybil attacks, allowing only top users to participate in consensus.

This approach not only allows a defense against Sybil attacks to be removed from the consensus, opening up the possibility of creating new types of faster and more efficient consensuses (such as [Proof of Victory](https://docs.elysium-chain.com/en/elysium/proof-of-victory)), but also implies that value is added to the world while mining.

At some point, we found ourselves with each social mechanic (quest mining, tokenomics) ready to be implemented as a standalone project. This way, by building Questfall, we will be able to test and tweak the mechanics before integrating them into the core of the Elysium blockchain.

Another reason to build Questfall is that all existing quest platforms have significant weaknesses, the most important of which are the lack of Sybil protection and poor tokenomics. This results in an overwhelming number of bots and uncertain rewards for users who do quests. We have first-hand experience of this, having attempted to assemble a decentralized group of real people as a pool of initial validators for Elysium.

Thus, Questfall is a big practical step towards Elysium, with its own value, as it will be the first quest platform without bots and multi-accounts, where people can actually earn money by doing meaningful quests.
