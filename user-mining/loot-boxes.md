# Loot boxes

Loot boxes are the only way to obtain items. \
Users can obtain lootboxes by buying them from the system with Gold or by doing certain activities on the platfrom. \
\
\
By doing activities users recieve fragments of treasure maps. After acquiring all fragments of a treasure map, the lootbox can be opened. \
\
The role of Luck\
Luck modifies the chances of getting multiple map pieces from completed quests and decreases the possibility of getting doubles. It plays an important role in opening extra boxes per completed quests.\
\

Opening lootboxes\
Each box requiers 10 individual map fragments. After acquiring all fragments the user gain 1 or more items depending on their luck attribute\
Higher the luck, higher the chances of getting extra items\
\
Opening system depending on Luck\
\
If a user has +1 Luck then his lootbox will yield exactly 1 random item. \
If a user has +4 Luck then he can win minimum 1 item and maximum 4 depending on how lucky he is when he chooses the cards. \
How it works?\
There are 4 cards upside down.\
After choosing one card the users receive the item(the first choice yields 100% an item) and the card is returned to the deck as a "dead-end" card\
Now the 4 cards consist of 3 item cards + 1 dead end card. If the users chooses the Item card, the game continues if he chooses the dead end card, the game ends. \
\
\
For each quest users will receive puzzle pieces. With this pieces the map for a treasury can be gathered. All pieces are from the same map. Meaning that you can have 5 pieces of one kind, 6 of another and none for the last (there could be any amount of pieces). So when you get the absent piece you just get the map. You can think of these map as they are tickets for the loot boxes. Luck attribute increases your chances to get the missing pieces. Additionally you can buy needed pieces by Gold. When you gathered all the pieces of one ticket (treasury map) you can open up a loot box with it. If you have luck 10 then when you open up a loot box you will get 10 cards (backs up). You choose the card representing a loot item. Then there is another round. You get 10 cards again. But one of them is a deadend card. If you choose this deadend card opening finishes. If you choose a card with the loot, then there will be a third round, but this time there will be 2 deadend card out of 10. So depending on your real luck (not attribute) you can get 10 items from one loot box. But the chances will decrease with each item. After you get 5 items there will be 5 deadend card out of 10. So it is 50/50 that you will be able to continue. So when you increase the Luck attribute you increase the amound of items you can get from one loot box.\
