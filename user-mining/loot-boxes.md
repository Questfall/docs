# Loot boxes

Loot boxes are the only way to obtain items. \
Users can obtain lootboxes by buying them from the system with Gold or by doing certain activities on the platfrom. \
\
\
By doing activities users recieve fragments of treasure maps. After acquiring all fragments of a treasure map, the lootbox can be opened. \
\
The role of Luck\
Luck modifies the chances of getting multiple map pieces from completed quests and decreases the possibility of getting doubles. It plays an important role in opening extra boxes per completed quests.\

Higher the luck, higher the chances of getting extra items\
\
Opening system depending on Luck\
\
If a user has +1 Luck then his lootbox will yield exactly 1 random item. \
If a user has +4 Luck then he can win minimum 1 item and maximum 4 depending on how lucky he is when he chooses the cards. \
How it works?\
There are 4 cards upside down.\
After choosing one card the users receive the item(the first choice yields 100% an item) and the card is returned to the deck as a "dead-end" card\
Now the 4 cards consist of 3 item cards + 1 dead end card. If the users chooses the Item card, the game continues if he chooses the dead end card, the game ends. \
