In Questfall, each user is represented as a character that is described with numeric parameters, the most important of which is the number of level.&#x20;

Every users starts mining quests as a character of level 1. And by participating in moderation users earn experience points (XP) that are used to increase their level.

With each level a user gets a free attribute point that can be applied to any of the character attributes:

* <mark style="color:purple;">**Constitution**</mark>: Increases the amount of weight a character can carry in his inventory;
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Vigour**</mark>: Increases the character's stamina limit;
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Regeneration**</mark>: Increases the rate at which the character's stamina replenishes;
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Intelligence**</mark>: Increases spell memory and the number of active spells available;
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Core**</mark>: Increases maximum mana capacity;
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Recharge**</mark>: Increases the rate at which mana is collected from the word;
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Precision**</mark>: Increases the efficiency of crafting and disassembling items;
* <mark style="color:purple;">**Luck**</mark>: Increases the chance of receiving more items from loot boxes;

By completing quests users earn activity points (ACT) and by participating in moderation users earn experience points (XP).

Earned ACT points are used to distribute reward at the end of the week and at the end of the season. ACT can be thought of as a mining power, which reset each reward perdiod (one week for a regular mining and three month for seasons).
