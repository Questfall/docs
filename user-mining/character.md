In Questfall, each user is represented as a character that is described with numeric parameters, the most important of which is the number of level.&#x20;

Every users starts mining quests as a character of level 1. And by participating in moderation users earn experience points (XP) that are used to increase their level.

* **Constitution**: Increases the amount of weight a character can carry in his inventory;
* **Vigour**: Increases the character's stamina limit;
* **Regeneration**: Increases the rate at which the character's stamina replenishes;
* **Intelligence**: Increases spell memory and the number of active spells available;
* **Core**: Increases maximum mana capacity;
* **Recharge**: Increases the rate at which mana is collected from the word;
* **Precision**: Increases the efficiency of crafting and disassembling items;
* **Luck**: Increases the chance of receiving more items from loot boxes;

By completing quests users earn activity points (ACT) and by participating in moderation users earn experience points (XP).

Earned ACT points are used to distribute reward at the end of the week and at the end of the season. ACT can be thought of as a mining power, which reset each reward perdiod (one week for a regular mining and three month for seasons).
