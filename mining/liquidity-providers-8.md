# ‚è≥ Liquidity providers (8%)

In order for investors to obtain Questfall Tokens (QFT) or for miners to sell their QFTs without significant price influence, it is necessary to ensure sufficient liquidity. This will be achieved through the use of 8% of the weekly QFT issuance, which will be permanently allocated to reward liquidity providers according to their share in the pool during a week.

The reward will be paid only to those who provide liquidity to the official Uniswap QFT-USDT pool. This is crucial as the price of this official pool will be used by Questfall to determine the debiting number of credits when QFTs are burned.
