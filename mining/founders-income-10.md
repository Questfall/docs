# â˜• Founders' income (10%)

It is hard to overstate the value of the Founders, as the Questfall platform would not exist without them. In recognition of their contribution, the Founders will receive 10% of the weekly QFT fund from the beginning and forever.

{% hint style="info" %}
In fact, the founders' percentage will be much higher before the other rewarded activities are launched as they are considered initial miners. Read more in the [roadmap](../roadmap.md).
{% endhint %}

The Team will initially keep 600,000 [Founder Points](../tokenomics/founders-nft.md) and sell 1,200,000 to the public during the [Initial Funding Event](../platform/development-funding.md). However, as the [NFT burns](nft-burning-2.md), the amount of Founder Points in circulation will decrease over time, meaning that the shares of the dedicated founders will increase.



The current status: <mark style="background-color:orange;">Not yet launched...</mark>&#x20;

### How the reward is distributed

The total amount of QFT to be rewarded to the founders in a given week is known in advance as it can be calculated by the formula. This fixed number of tokens will be distributed to all Founders NFT holders on Sundays, according to the individual Founders Points share of each NFT holder. The reward is accrued for the particular NFT, and to get actual tokens in the wallet, founders must claim them.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This means that if QFTs are not claimed, they can be sold or even burned along with the NFT.
