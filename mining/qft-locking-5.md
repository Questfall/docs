# ðŸ”“ QFT locking (5%)

Ensuring that tokens are not sold by the user for a certain period of time benefits the system. To encourage such behavior, 5% of the weekly QFT fund will be used to reward those users who lock their tokens in the system for 15 weeks.

{% hint style="info" %}
We do not use the word "staking" as it implies the possibility of losing the stake, whereas locking guarantees that the amount cannot be reduced.
{% endhint %}

Token lock rewards begin before the launch of Questfall and will continue indefinitely. This means that the number of QFTs in circulation will be reduced not only by burning tokens, but also by locking them.

### How the locking mechanism works

At the initial lock, the QFT holder locks the tokens in the system for 15 weeks, and obviously the lock period decreases by one every week. At the same time, a fixed number of QFTs, used as a reward for locking, are distributed according to the individual locking power of each user. This locking power is calculated as the product of the locked tokens and the number of weeks remaining in the lock period.

For example, if the user has locked 100 QFTs, his locking power will be 1500 at the end of the first week and 1400 at the end of the second week. In other words, the multiplier used to calculate locking power decreases by one each week: 15, 14, 13, .... 1, 0.

To receive the maximum locking power, a user can re-lock tokens at any time for a maximum of 15 weeks. This means that in order to receive the maximum locking reward in perpetuity, the user must re-lock his tokens on a weekly basis.
