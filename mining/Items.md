# Items

IMAGE OF INVENTORY WITH ITEMS

 There are a variety of in-game **Items** comprising **Clothing**, **Spellbooks**, **Elixirs**, and **Potions** which give bonuses to the character and game play. 

Items can be acquired from **Loot Boxes** and **Marketplace.** 

***

### Tier and Level

**Clothing**, **Spell books** and **Elixirs** comes in six different **Tiers**:

* Common (F) 	
* Advanced (E) 	
* Rare (D)	
* Legendary (C) 	
* Epic (B) 	
* Mythic (A) 	

The higher the tier of the item the more powerful and heavier it is.
In addition to the tier, clothing also has **Level** that affects the item's bonuses.

***

### Clothing

IMAGE OF CLOTHING

There are multiple types of **Clothing** and the character has six slots to wear them, one for each body part:

* **Head** (helmets, hoods, hats)
* **Chest** (robes, tunics, shirts, vests)
* **Leg** (pants, trousers)
* **Feet** (boots, shoes)
* **Hand** (gloves, gauntlets)
* **Back** (capes, cloaks, mantles) 

Wearing clothing provides many benefits to the character, such as bonuses to mining power, attributes, mana or stamina. 

The character can wear clothing of any level or tier. If the level of the item is higher than the character level, the item and its effects will be downgraded (while equipped) to the character level while the tier and weight stay the same. The higher the level and tier of the clothing, the greater the bonuses and weight.

All types of clothing can be seen as equal in quality as they give the same amount of bonuses for the same weight. However, every kind of clothing has a unique weight ratio making some items heavier and more powerful than others. Trousers of the same level and tier will weigh more than a hat and give higher effects.

{% hint style="info" %}
The weight of clothing is directly affected by its tier and level, and can be calculated using the following formula: 10 grams * Level * Tier (F=1, E=2).
{% endhint %}

The level and tier of clothing can be upgraded with [Crafting](./crafting.md).




### Spell Books

IMAGE OF SPELL BOOK

Users can learn spells from the spell books by consuming them. 
For each spell, there are six tiers of spell books.

Spell Books do not have a level and the tier can be upgraded.

For more details see [Magic](magic.md).

### Elixirs

IMAGE OF ELIXIR

The **Elixirs** provide beneficial effects to the character which vary a lot ranging from attribute boosts to reducing the cooldown of all of the character spells. 

Consuming an elixir gives either a **temporary** or **permanent** effects.

**Lower-tier elixirs** (F, E, D) give temporary effects.\
**Higher-tier elixirs** (C, B, A) give permanent effects.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are full lines of elixirs that come in all six tiers and others
that are unique to only one or a few tiers. For Example, elixir can have only permanent effects like giving an extra marketplace slot.
{% endhint %}

There are four categories of elixirs:

* **Attribute Elixirs** – Increases the base attribute points of the character. Each attribute has one elixir, and these points can’t be redistributed with an attribute reset.
* **Mystic Elixirs** – These affect things related to magic, spells, and mana, like reducing the mana cost of all the character's spells. 
* **Power Elixirs** - Gives a boost to the mining power, stamina, and the ability to carry more items, like speeding up the stamina recovery.
* **Fortune Elixirs** – These affect things related to lucky strikes, loot boxes, shards, and trading, like boosting the probability of bonus chances.


Elixirs do not have a level and the tier can't be upgraded.

### Potions

IMAGE OF POTION

There are two different types of **Potions**: 

* **Stamina Potions** - Consuming fully replenishes the stamina reserves.
* **Mana Potions** - Consuming fully replenishes the mana reserves. 

Potions do not have a tier or level and there is only one size of both types.

### Loot Boxes

IMAGE OF LOOT BOX

**Loot Boxes** are the primary source of all **RPG items**. They can be obtained by buying directly from the system for **100 Gold** ($1) each or by collecting a full set of [Chest Shards](./character.md).

By default, a loot box provides one item, with the chance of it being any type, tier, or level. Users can increase their chances of receiving more items by placing points in the [Luck attribute](./character.md) and by consuming a specific elixir.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Gold spent on buying loot boxes is automatically burned by the system.
{% endhint %}

The function of a loot box is closer to in-game Gold than items as they do not influence the carried weight or stamina consumption and can be opened without using essence. As the items found in the loot box have weight, the box can’t be opened if the character weight limit is fully used. The loot boxes are individualized for the user and can’t be traded with other users.  

### Drop Rates

The items drop rate from a loot box decreases 10 times with each tier. For example, Legendary (C) item is 10 times less likely to drop from a loot box than the same item as Rare (D). 

This makes the higher-tier items extremely valuable and hard to find in the loot boxes. If the chance of finding an F-tier clothing is 1 in 10 it makes the chances of finding an A-tier clothing 1 in 1 million. 

As finding higher-tier items is so difficult and elixirs and spell books are consumed, the game will never be over-saturated with powerful items. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Loot boxes are the only way new items are released into circulation. 
{% endhint %}

### Marketplace Trading

IMAGE OF QUESTFALL MARKETPLACE

All the users have access to the two **marketplaces** where items can be bought or sold for **Gold** (in-game) and **QFT** (on-chain) between the users.

Marketplace trading of items is directly linked to the character's inventory – All bought items go directly to inventory and those placed on sale are moved from the inventory to the marketplace slots.

### Trading for Gold

In the in-game marketplace the **lower-tier** items F, E, and D are traded for **Gold**.

Each user has a limited number of marketplace slots where lower-tier items can be placed for sale for a chosen fixed Gold price.

{% hint style="info" %}
First-level character starts with 3 Marketplace Slots, and each subsequent Marketplace Slot requires another 5 points of Crafting attribute.
{% endhint %}

### Trading for QFT

In the on-chain marketplace the **higher-tier** items C, B, and A, are traded for **QFT**.

Users can place the higher-tier items on sale to the marketplace directly from the inventory for a fixed price of QFT. Trading on-chain does not use the character's marketplace slots and allows users to place any number of items on sale.

Also, these items can be withdrawn from- and deposited into the inventory as NFTs. For more details about on-chain trading of items see [Marketplace](../infrastructure/marketplace.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
As the trading of higher-tier items happens on-chain the user must pay the Polygon gas fee for each transaction.
{% endhint %}

### Marketplace Rules

The marketplace offers free trade between users but there are some rules to both types of trading:

* Every trade has a 5% fee (Gold/QFT) which is burned immediately by the system.
* Items can be traded only for Gold or QFT and can’t be exchanged for other items.
* User can transfer items to inventory (buying or depositing) only if the character can carry its weight.
