# Items

 There are a variety of in-game items comprising **Clothing**, **Spellbooks**, **Elixirs**, and **Potions** which give bonuses to the character and game play. 

Items can be acquired from **loot boxes** and **marketplace.** 

***

### Clothing

There are multiple types of clothing and the character has six slots to wear them, one for each body part:

* **Head** (helmets, hoods, hats)
* **Chest** (robes, tunics, shirts, vests)
* **Leg** (pants, trousers)
* **Feet** (boots, shoes)
* **Hand** (gloves, gauntlets)
* **Back** (capes, cloaks, mantles) 

Wearing clothing can give various benefits like bonuses to mining power, character attributes, mana, stamina, or spell slots.

The character can wear clothing of any level. If the level of the item is higher than the Character Level, the item and its effects will be downgraded (while equipped) to the Character Level while the weight stays the same.

### Spellbooks

### Elixirs

The **elixirs** provide beneficial effects to the character which vary a lot ranging from attribute boosts to reducing the cooldown of all of the character spells. 

Consuming an elixir gives either a **temporary** or **permanent** effects.

**Lower-tier elixirs** (F, E, D) give temporary effects.\
**Higher-tier elixirs** (C, B, A) give permanent effects.

There are **four categories of Elixirs**:

* **Attribute Elixirs** – Increases the attribute points of the character. 
* **Mystic Elixirs** – These affect primarily the mana and spells, like reducing the mana cost of all the character's spells. 
* **Power Elixirs** - Gives a boost to the mining power, stamina, and the ability to carry and trade more items.
* **Fortune Elixirs** – Increases the changes for lucky strikes, like boosting the probability of doubling bonuses.

Elixirs do not have level and the tier can't be upgraded.

### Potions

There are two different types of potions: 

* **Stamina Potions** - Consuming fully replenishes the stamina reserves.
* **Mana Potions** - Consuming fully replenishes the mana reserves. 

Potions do not have tier or level and there is only one size of both types.

### Tier and Level

**Clothing**, **spellbooks** and **elixirs** comes in six different tiers:

* Common (F) 	
* Advanced (E) 	
* Rare (D)	
* Legendary (C) 	
* Epic (B) 	
* Mythic (A) 	

The higher the **tier** of the item the **more powerful** and **heavier** it is.

In addition to the tier, clothing has also **level.** The higher the clothing level the more bonuses it has and the more it weighs.

For more details about tier and level bonuses see [Crafting](crafting.md).

### Loot boxes

**Loot boxes** are the primary source of all **RPG items**. They can be obtained by buying directly from the system for **100 gold** (1$) each or by collecting a full set of **chest shards**. Chest shards can be earned by completing quests.

{% hint style="info" %}
The gold spent on buying loot boxes is automatically burned by the system.
{% endhint %}

By default, a loot box provides one item, with the chance of it being any type, tier, or level. Users can increase their chances of receiving more items by placing points in the Luck attribute. 

For more details about the function of **chest shards** and **luck attribute** see the [character section](character.md).

The items **drop rate** from a loot box decreases 10 times with each tier. For example, Legendary (C) item is 10 times less likely to drop from a loot box than the same item as Rare (D). 


{% hint style="info" %}
Loot boxes are the only way new items are released into circulation. 
{% endhint %}

The function of a loot box is closer to in-game gold than items:

*  Loot boxes do not influence the carried weight or stamina consumption
*  There is no limit to how many loot boxes can be bought or carried
*  Loot boxes can be stored indefinitely and be opened at any time without using essence

There are a few limitations regarding loot boxes:

*  They can’t be traded with other users
*  Loot box can’t be opened if the character weight limit is fully used
