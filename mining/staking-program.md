# ðŸ“ˆ Staking tokens

\
Questfall is using 3 different staking approaches to secure the platform and rewards its users\
\
1\. Investors staking\
&#x20;   Staking QFT as an investor will provide passive income. The reward comes from fees generated by platform usage and a small % of mined tokens\
\
2\. User staking(miners)\
&#x20;   Staking tokens as a user increases the mining power. Mining power acts as an XP multiplier \
\
3\. Validators staking\
&#x20;   Staking QFT as a validator increases the earnings\
&#x20;   Validators lose a % of the staked QFT is they are not in the majority(validating wrong or trying to game the system)
