# Trading

### Marketplace Trading

INTRO NEEDED

All the users have access to the in-game marketplace in which items can be bought or sold for Gold between the users.

Each user has a limited number of marketplace slots where items can be placed for sale for a chosen fixed Gold price. 

{% hint style="info" %}
A first-level character starts with 3 Marketplace Slots, and each subsequent Marketplace Slot requires another 5 points of Crafting attribute. 
{% endhint %}

The marketplace offers free trade between users but there are some rules to it:
* Every trade has a 5% Gold fee which is burned immediately by the system.
* Items can be traded only for Gold and canâ€™t be exchanged for other items.
* User can buy items from the marketplace only if the character can carry its weight.
* Only the lower-tier items F, E, and D can be traded within the marketplace. 

*** 

### On-Chain Trading

Higher-tier items C, B, and A can be withdrawn and traded only on-chain.
