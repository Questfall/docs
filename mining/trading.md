# Trading

### Marketplace Trading

**IMAGE OF QUESTFALL MARKETPLACE**

All the users have access to the in-game **marketplace** where items can be bought or sold for **Gold** (F, E, D) and **QFT** (C, B, A) between the users.

***

### Trading for Gold

The lower-tier items F, E, and D are traded only for Gold. 

Each user has a limited number of marketplace slots where items can be placed for sale for a chosen fixed Gold price. 

{% hint style="info" %}
A first-level character starts with 3 Marketplace Slots, and each subsequent Marketplace Slot requires another 5 points of Crafting attribute. 
{% endhint %}

### Trading for QFT

The higher-tier items C, B, and A, are traded only for QFT.

The trading happens in the marketplace as with lower items but every action is on-chain. So by buying or placing higher-tier items on sale, the user must pay the Polygon gas fee. 

The item can be withdrawn from the platform as each higher-tier item is a unique NFT.

### Marketplace Rules

The marketplace offers free trade between users but there are some rules to both types of trading:

* Every trade has a 5% fee (Gold/QFT) which is burned immediately by the system.
* Items can be traded only for Gold or QFT and canâ€™t be exchanged for other items.
* User can buy items from the marketplace only if the character can carry its weight.
