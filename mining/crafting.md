# Crafting

IMAGE OF CRAFTING

**Crafting** allows users to upgrade **Clothing** with essence and disassemble any item for essence. Additionally, **Spell Books** can be upgraded by merging them together.

This creates an additional layer of game mechanics and gives users the ability to get an edge by advancing their equipment. Crafting adds value to all types of items in Questfall as any item can be disassembled and used as a source of **Essence**.

***

### Item Weight

The item's weight, amount of essence it contains, and tier and level are directly correlated. By disassembling any item user gets a percentage of the essence it contains. For more details see the [Essence Balance](character.md)

Essence is a highly valued resource as in addition to crafting it is needed to equip and unequip clothing and it canâ€™t be bought or traded.

The crafting efficiency can be increased by adding points to the **Crafting Attribute**.

### Clothing

The amount of boosts **Clothing** gives depends on its tier and level which can be upgraded by crafting.

The heavier the clothing the more essence is needed for upgrading it. Users can freely choose to upgrade either the tier or level of clothing. Any level item can be evolved by tier and any tier item can be increased in level. The cost/benefit ratio is the same with both upgrades but evolving the tier often consumes more essence at one time as it has a greater effect on item bonuses. 

* **The tier upgrade** adds randomly a new effect to the clothing and the item level stays the same. When the item gets a new upgradable effect (F -> E, E -> D), the power of the new effect is based on the clothing level.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example A level 20 common (F) helmet gives +2% to mining efficiency, and by evolving it to Advanced (E), it will give +2% to mining efficiency and +10 to mana. (+0.5 mana for each level)
{% endhint %}

* **The level upgrade** linearly increases the effect of all the upgradable bonuses within the clothing. All the non-upgradable bonuses stay the same. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For example A level 10 rare (D) robe gives +1% to mining efficiency, +5 to mana, and +5 stamina, by upgrading it to level 11 it gives 1.1% to mining efficiency, +5.5 to mana, and +5.5 to stamina. 
{% endhint %}

All tier of clothing has upgradeable effects and the higher tier also has non-upgradable effects. The number of **upgradable** and **non-upgradable** effects is based on the tier:

*  1/0 - Common (F) 	
*  2/0 - Advanced (E) 	
*  3/0 - Rare (D) 	
*  3/1 - Legendary (C) 	
*  3/2 - Epic (B) 	
*  3/3 - Mythic (A) 	


### Spell Books

Each spell has six levels of power corresponding to the tiers of **Spell Books**. The power of spells increases exponentially with the tiers.

To upgrade the spell books tier, users need to merge 5 books of the same type and rarity for one higher-tier book.
