# Crafting

IMAGE OF CRAFTING

**Crafting** allows users to upgrade **Clothing** with essence and disassemble any item for essence. Additionally, **Spell Books** can be upgraded by merging them together.

This creates an additional layer of game mechanics and gives users the ability to get an edge by advancing their equipment. Crafting adds value to all types of items in Questfall as any item can be disassembled and used as a source of **Essence**.

### Weight and Essence

The item's weight, amount of essence it contains, and tier and level are directly correlated. The heavier the clothing the more essence is needed for upgrading it. 

By disassembling any item user gets a percentage of the essence it contains. The number of essences received from disassembling an item can be increased by adding points to the crafting attribute. 

For more details about the amounts of essence needed for upgrading and received from disassembling see the [Essence Balance](character.md).

Essence is a highly valued resource as in addition to upgrading it is needed to equip and unequip clothing and it can’t be bought or traded.

### Clothing Upgrade

The amount of boosts **Clothing** gives depends on its tier and level which can be upgraded by crafting.

Users can freely choose to upgrade either the tier or level of clothing. Any level item can be evolved by tier and any tier item can be increased in level. The cost/benefit ratio is the same with both upgrades but evolving the tier often consumes more essence at one time as it has a greater effect on item bonuses. 

* **The Tier Upgrade** adds randomly a new effect to the clothing and the item level stays the same. When the item gets a new upgradable effect (F to E, E to D), the power of the new effect is based on the clothing level.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, A level 20 common (F) helmet gives +6% to mining efficiency, and by evolving it to Advanced (E), it will give +6% to mining efficiency and +2000 to mana. (+100 mana for each level)
{% endhint %}

All tier of clothing has upgradeable effects that can be leveled up and the higher tier also has non-upgradable effects that can’t be leveled up. 

The number of **upgradable** and **non-upgradable** effects is based on the tier:

*  1/0 - Common (F) 	
*  2/0 - Advanced (E) 	
*  3/0 - Rare (D) 	
*  3/1 - Legendary (C) 	
*  3/2 - Epic (B) 	
*  3/3 - Mythic (A)

Within the same higher tier, clothing of the same level can vary in quality. This is because the strength of the new non-upgradable effect is randomly generated within a specific range. Non-upgradable effects already in the clothing remain unchanged when the tier is upgraded. 

The power range of the non-upgradable effect will get higher with each tier: 

* C 50% - 100%
* B 100% - 200%
* A 200% - 300%

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the base effect is +10 to the mining attribute B-tier item would randomly give between 10-20 points.
{% endhint %}

 * **The Level Upgrade** linearly increases the effect of all the upgradable bonuses within the clothing. All the non-upgradable bonuses stay the same. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, A level 10 rare (C) robe gives +4% to mining efficiency, +1000 to mana, +1000 stamina, and +10 to crafting attribute, by upgrading it to level 11 it gives 4.4% to mining efficiency, +1100 to mana, and +1100 to stamina, and +10 to crafting attribute. 
{% endhint %}

There is no fixed maximum level for the items as it will increase based on the level of the highest-level users.

### Spell Book Upgrade

Each spell has six levels of power corresponding to the tiers of **Spell Books**. The power of spells increases exponentially with the tiers.

To upgrade the spell books tier, users need to merge five books of the same type and rarity for one higher-tier book.
