# ‚è≥ Liquidity Program (10%)

In order for investors to obtain Questfall Tokens (QFT) or for miners to sell their QFTs without significant price influence, it is necessary to ensure sufficient liquidity. In order to motivate liquidity providers, Questfall will launch the Liquidity Program shortly after the QFT issuance start. This program assumes that 10% of the weekly QFT issuance will be forever distributed to liquidity providers according to their share in the pool.

The Liquidity Program offers incentives only to those who provide liquidity to the official Uniswap QFT - USDT pool. In addition to facilitating trading, the price of this official swapping pool will be used by Questfall to determine the debiting number of credits when QFTs are burned.



The current status of the Liquidity Program: <mark style="background-color:orange;">Not yet launched...</mark>&#x20;
