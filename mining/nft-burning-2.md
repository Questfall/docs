# ðŸ”¥ NFT burning (2%)

Our goal is to maximize the value of NFTs. To achieve this, 2% of the [weekly QFT fund](../tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will be allocated for the purchase of [Miners ](../tokenomics/miners-nft.md)(1%) and [Founders](../tokenomics/founders-nft.md) (1%) NFTs from the market via auction, with the subsequent burning of these NFTs.

The buyback and burning of NFTs will begin shortly before the launch of Questfall and will continue until there are no NFTs left in circulation. This will not only ensure that the price of NFTs rises in the long term but will also increase the share of each Founder who does not burn their [units](../tokenomics/founders-nft.md).



The current status: <mark style="background-color:orange;">Not yet launched...</mark>&#x20;

### How the auction works

Users who want to burn their NFTs for QFT should put NFT in the auction smart contract and set the price for the NFT's&#x20;

The NFTs will be burned through auction mechanics,&#x20;
