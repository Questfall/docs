# ðŸ”¥ NFT burning (2%)

Our goal is to maximize the price of NFTs over the long term. To achieve this, 2% of the [weekly QFT fund](../tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will be allocated for the purchase of [Miners ](../tokenomics/miners-nft.md)(1%) and [Founders](../tokenomics/founders-nft.md) (1%) NFTs from the market via auction, with the subsequent burning of these NFTs.

The buyback and burning of NFTs will begin shortly before the launch of Questfall and will continue until there are no NFTs left in circulation. This will not only ensure that the price of NFTs raises in the long term but will also increase the share of each founder who does not burn their [units](../tokenomics/founders-nft.md).



The current status: <mark style="background-color:orange;">Not yet launched...</mark>&#x20;

### How the auction works

There will be two independent auctions each week, one for Miners NFTs and one for Founders NFTs. In these two auctions, the system will use 2% of the weekly QFT fund (1% for each type of NFT) to buy back NFTs offered by users. User offers will be ranked according to the price of the NFT parameter - one cent for Miners NFTs or one point for Founders NFTs.

Bought NFTs will be burned and the remaining QFTs allocated for buyback will be carried over to the next week. This means that if the system does not propose enough to buy even one NFT this week, the amount allocated for buyback will be increased at the next auction. After several such accumulations, the system is guaranteed to meet user bids.

Due to the limitations of smart contracts, the maximum number of offers that can be filled each week is 50.
{% endhint %}

This means that the last owners of each type of NFT will have the most to gain. In fact, they will be able to get as many QFTs for them as they are willing to wait for, as the amount the system will offer for burning NFTs will increase each week.
