# Rewards

In Questfall the users don’t need to grind quests for nothing or wait for rewards that will never arrive. The unique reward system and deflationary tokenomics allows ordinary users to be generously rewarded with QFT for their effort in completing quests.

There is no pre-mining of the QFT and the limited total supply of tokens is issued weekly in decreasing amounts determined by a pre-defined formula, and 40% of this QFT weekly issue goes directly to miners.

## Leagues

The **Leagues** allow a fair sharing of rewards and prevent bots and multi-accounts from taking the reward of real dedicated users. 

The leagues group the users based on their level in **15-level sections** in the following way:

* First-league  5-20
* Second-league 20-35
* Third-league 35-50
* And so on without a top limit

{% hint style="info" %}
User’s levels 0-5 are part of a  Zero League that is considered a tutorial and does not provide rewards.
{% endhint %}

The **40% weekly miners reward** is shared equally with each league with active users. The user has to compete for the weekly QFT reward only with users in the same league. As entering a higher league takes more effort than a lower one, the number of users competing for the same reward decreases with each league.

The user's weekly **QFT reward** is based on the **league level** and **Mining Score**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there were only four leagues with active users, each league would have 10% of the weekly QFT reward to share. Each user would earn a portion of this 10% based on their mining score relative to the total number of points mined in that league.
{% endhint %}

In addition to having less competition in a higher league, the users can be motivated to get to a new league for a free attribute reset. When a user joins a new league, he can redistribute the character's attribute points once for free and thus re-design their game approach.

## Seasons

While the concept of mining is fair enough on its own, platforms like Questfall (where users create value for others) offer additional rewards for the most loyal and engaged users, as this encourages long-term audience retention and therefore value.

To achieve this, 16% of the newly created QFTs will be placed each week in the **Seasonal Reward Pool**, from which **11.2%** will be distributed each season to **Users** with the highest mining score. 

{% hint style="info" %}
A common season will last three months (twelve weeks), during which a fund of approximately 120% of average weekly token creation will be collected. By rewarding only the most engaged users, the system will ensure that they receive a noticeable reward.
{% endhint %}

This approach also allows for seasonal collaborations with other projects, which not only brings additional rewards to users, but also encourages QFT burning, as to become a Questfall Season Partner, a third-party team must burn QFT.
