**IMAGE OF SPELL SLOTS WITH SPELLS**

Users can learn and cast **magical spells** to gain advantages on the platform. Spells affect the outside objects rather than directly influencing the character.

Most spells can enhance the user's performance, for example, by increasing quest rewards, affecting item bonuses, or freezing stamina usage. However, some spells can have global effects on the platform like changing the overall theme for some time.

***

### Spells

The spells can be learned from **spell books** and unlearned by simply deleting them. When learning, a spell the book is consumed, and the spell appears on one of the character **spell slots**. Each character starts with one spell slot, and the number of slots can be increased by adding points to **magic attribute** and through items.

Each spell has **6 levels of power** represented by the tiers of spell books. The power of spells increases exponentially with the tiers making Mythic (A) spells over 10 times more powerful than Common (F) spells. 

{% hint style="info" %}
To **upgrade** the spell books tier, users need to merge 5 books of the same type and rarity for one higher-tier book. For example, 5 common (F) books with the same spell can merged to create an Advanced (E) book of the same spell.
{% endhint %}

Casting a spell **consumes mana**, so the ability to cast powerful or multiple spells is also based on the character's mana reserves. The more powerful the spell, the more mana it consumes. In addition to mana cost, some spells have a **cooldown period** which always lengthens as the power increases.
