### Base Reward

Each quest has a **Mining Score** count that works as a **Base Reward** for the quest. By completing the quests users get the base reward of mining points which is then multiplied by the user's mining efficiency bonuses.

The base rewards of quests range from 10 (no promotion) up to <1000 (1000 is unreachable) depending on the author's promotion size. 


### Mining Efficiency 

By increasing the personal **Mining Efficiency** bonus a user can receive more mining points from each completed quest. The base reward of a quest is multiplied by the mining efficiency % bonus the user has. 

For example, if the base reward for the quest is 50 mining points and the user has 100% of the mining bonus, they receive 100 mining points from completing the quest.

Constant mining efficiency bonus can be increased by wearing clothing, elixirs, rating quests, and adding points to the mining attribute. Spells and Elixirs can give mining bonuses for a limited time or to a specific quest.

### Result of Completion 

Each answer submission for a quest is reviewed by the system automatically or by the moderators. If the submission is accepted, the user receives the reward, and the quest is moved from the global quest feed to the completed feed.

If the submission is declined, the base reward of the quest decreases based on the number of retries the author has set for the quest. For example, if there are a maximum of five retries on a quest, each wrong submission decreases the base reward by 1/5 for the user.

A user can try to re-submit an acceptable answer when there are unused retries and the quest is still active.
