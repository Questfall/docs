# Quests

**IMAGE OF QUEST CARD**

### Completion Types

The completion requirements of a quest are up to the author's imagination, but the forms in which the quest is completed are limited.

For the completion of a quest the required submission type can be one of the following:

* **Link** – 
* **Text** –
* **Quiz** –
* **Survey** – 
* **Transaction** – 


***

### Quest Duration

Each quest's duration ranges from 1 to 30 days depending on the number of days the author chose to promote their quest. Users can submit answers to the quest as long as it’s active. 

The length of the quest does not affect the size of the reward.

***

### Quest Sorting

Users can sort the quest feed to display all, followed, marked, hidden, or completed quests.

* **Followed** - The authors can be followed as creators in popular social media platforms. Users can choose to sort the feed to show quests only from those authors they are following. 
* **Marked** - The users can mark those quests they see as interesting or important and create and display a feed based on them. 
* **Hidden** - Undesirable quests can be hidden from the global feed by the user. Feed can be sorted to display all the hidden quests.
* **Completed** - The completed quests are automatically removed from the global feed and moved to the completed section.

### Base Reward

Each quest has a **Base Reward** of a certain number of **Mining Points**. By completing the quests users get the base reward of mining points which is then multiplied by the user's mining efficiency bonuses.

The base rewards of quests range from 10 (no promotion) up to <1000 (1000 is unreachable) depending on the author's promotion size. 


### Mining Efficiency 

By increasing the personal **Mining Efficiency** bonus a user can receive more mining points from each completed quest. The base reward of a quest is multiplied by the mining efficiency % bonus the user has. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the base reward for the quest is 50 mining points and the user has 100% of mining bonus, they receive 100 mining points from completing the quest.
{% endhint %}

Constant mining efficiency bonus can be increased by clothing, elixirs, rating quests, and adding points to the mining attribute. Spells and Elixirs can give mining bonuses for a limited time or to a specific quest.

### Result of Completion 

Each answer submission for a quest is reviewed by the system automatically or by the moderators. If the submission is accepted, the user receives the reward, and the quest is moved from the global quest feed to the completed feed.

If the submission is declined, the base reward of the quest decreases based on the number of retries the author has set for the quest. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if there are a maximum of five retries on a quest, each wrong submission decreases the base reward by 1/5 for the user.
{% endhint %}

A user can try to re-submit an acceptable answer when there are unused retries and the quest is still active.

### Reporting of Quests

To make the platform a safe and enjoyable environment, users can report quests seen as inappropriate or breaking the server rules. 

Users can be motivated to report quests not only cause of their goodwill but also because of a Silver reward. The system rewards users for valid reports and punishes them for wrong ones.

The reporting of quests works as follows:

1. The user reports a quest they consider breaking the server rules.
2. This report goes to moderators for voting. Reported quests are prioritized over every other moderation for fast results.
3. Moderators vote yes/no if this quest breaks server rules and should be removed from the platform. If the majority (weighted by user level) vote yes, the quest is removed, the reporter earns a Silver reward, and the quest creator is punished heavily. If moderators vote no, the reporter loses Silver. Moderators earn by voting with the majority.

To prevent abusing of the reporting system, only users above a certain level can report quests on the platform.
