### Quest Duration

Each quest's duration ranges from 1 to 7 days depending on the number of days the author chose to promote their quest. Users can submit answers for review as long as the quest is active. 

***

Users can sort their quest feed based on the author they have chosen to follow, the quests they have noted as marked or hidden, and completed quests.

### Base Reward

Each quest has a **Mining Score** count that works as a **Base Reward** for the quest. By completing the quests users get the base reward of mining points which is then multiplied by the user's mining efficiency bonuses.

The base rewards of quests range from 1 (no promotion) up to <100 (100 is unreachable) depending on the author's promotion size.

### Result of Completion 

Each answer submission for a quest is reviewed by the system automatically or by the moderators. If the submission is accepted, the user receives the reward, and the quest is moved from the global quest feed to the completed feed.

If the submission is declined, the base reward of the quest decreases based on the number of retries the author has set for the quest. For example, if there are a maximum of five retries on a quest, each wrong submission decreases the base reward by 1/5 for the user.

A user can try to re-submit an acceptable answer when there are unused retries and the quest is still active.
