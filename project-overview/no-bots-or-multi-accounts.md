# ðŸ¤– - No bots or multi-accounts

To prevent bots and multi-accounts there will be used two approaches in Questfall: user stakes and user levels. Since the amount of QFT that is distributed each week to miners is fixed, the users will compete with each other for the share they receive. This miners' competition will force users to use any opportunity to gain any advantage.

Thus, having bigger stake or getting higher RPG level will allow users to obtain advantage over others, which also makes bots and several accounts usage less profitable than focusing only on one account.

Mining is a concept where users are rewarded by the issuance of a token in proportion to the value they add to the system. This approach was first implemented in Bitcoin, but unfortunately it has not been taken any further than the Proof of Work consensus. And the main reason for that is Sybil attacks, simply put, bots and multi-accounts that allow abuse of the system.

There have been many attempts in recent years to implement different approaches to proving that a user is human - from various KYC systems with anonymous NFTs to all sorts of pedometers and clickers. However, none of these approaches have been successful because they all can be circumvented, giving the bot farmers an advantage.

So, it's no surprise that all the existing quest platforms have a huge number of bots and multi-accounts, making them virtually useless for the majority of users.&#x20;
