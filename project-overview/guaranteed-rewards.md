# ðŸ‘› - Guaranteed rewards

Mining is a concept where users are rewarded by the issuance of a token in proportion to the value they add to the system. This approach was first implemented in Bitcoin, but unfortunately it has not been taken any further than the Proof of Work consensus. And the main reason for that is Sybil attacks, simply put, bots and multi-accounts that allow abuse of the system.

#### Deflationary mining

Deflationary mining concept (the article will follow) assumes that users who add value to the system are periodically rewarded with respect to their contribution (during the period) by the issuance of the token with the limited total supply. This way such users are considered miners, and it is assumed that tokens could be obtained through mining only. To add to such a mining deflationary flavor there should be a way to burn tokens for some valuable product of the system.

In relation to Questfall project this concept applies as such:

* Questfall Token (QFT) total supply is 10 000 000, which is issued weekly by decreasing portions. The amount of QFT that will be issued any particular week could be calculated by the formula. There is no pre-minting of the QFT, which means that the only way to obtain newly issued QFT is through mining.&#x20;

* QFTs issued each week are distributed with respect to contribution to those who has brought value to the system during the week. This means that QFT can be obtained as a reward for certain valuable actions without having to buy it.

* By burning QFT any author can obtain off-chain system Credits (at a fixed USD price), which can be used for the quest promotion to the platform users. This means that after some market saturation period the circulating supply of QFT will steadily decline.
