# ðŸ’¸ Deflationary tokenomics

When new tokens are issued, they take value away from holders, whereas burning tokens adds value. Although everyone will want to get the newly printed tokens for free, burning without compensation results in losses and therefore only makes sense for altruists who benefit others at the expense of their own interests. Therefore, to make burning tokens attractive, users must receive some value from the system in return.

In Questfall, users who burn QFTs receive Credits (at a fixed price of $1), which in turn can be burned by authors to promote their quests, or by users to gain humanity without completing challenges. In this way, on the one hand, QFT tokens are issued each week, and on the other, they are simultaneously burned for Credits. This dialectic has several advantages.

Firstly, the supply of QFT tokens in circulation will initially increase, as there will be no QFT tokens to begin with, but as the market saturates, the number of QFT tokens in circulation will slowly decrease over time. This means that the price of QFT will rise in the long run, even if the demand from existing Questfall users who want to get an edge on the platform remains constant. This makes QFT tokenomics very different from any non-deflationary approach, which is essentially a Ponzi scheme, as existing holders can only cash out at the expense of newcomers.

Secondly, the increase in the QFT price due to the influx of new money from investors makes mining more profitable, thus attracting new users to quest activity and infrastructure support.

Thirdly, the volatility of the QFT price does not affect third-party projects that want to promote their quests to the Questfall audience, as the Credits needed to do so have a fixed price in dollars. So, if someone wants to spend some stablecoins on promotion, they will get the same number of Credits regardless of the price of QFT. The QFT price changes will only affect miners, who will receive a different number of Credits for their QFTs.

Fourthly, as the price of QFT tends to rise in the long term, the number of Credits (and therefore the value that can be obtained from the system) for a QFT token will increase over time. This is exactly how deflation works - the longer consumers wait, the more value they will receive for the same amount of money.

Fifthly, as the price of QFT falls, the number of tokens burned will increase, as more QFTs will have to be burned to obtain the same number of Credits. This leads to a rapid trend reversal due to a shrinking circulating supply.

In summary, deflationary tokenomics is much healthier than any other, and is based on the idea that those who wait, earn. But for tokens to burn there should be some value that the system provides, in the case of Questfall it is an engaged and active audience of quest miners.
