# ðŸ’¸ - Deflationary tokenomics

The weekly QFT fund is at the heart of the Questfall tokenomics and is formed during a given week from two sources:

* The weekly QFT issue, which can be calculated in advance [using the formula](../tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md),

{% hint style="info" %}
Before Questfall is launched, the weekly issue will be the only source for the weekly QFT fund, so in the [Roadmap](../roadmap/version-1.0.md) we use "weekly QFT issue" instead of "weekly QFT fund" as it is clearer.
{% endhint %}

* QFT tokens that come back during a week into circulation after Credits have been purchased.

{% hint style="info" %}
Not all QFT tokens are burned when Credits are bought, otherwise the miners' profits will fall in the long run as all the value goes to the QFT holders. More details can be found in the [Deflationary Mining](mining-approach.md) article, but in short, the greater the percentage of QFT that is burned, the more tokens are returned to circulation.

The full amount of the weekly QFT fund is distributed on Sunday evening in pre-determined portions to users who have added value to the platform in various areas:

* 40% to users who complete quests
* 20% to authors who create quests
* 6% to authors who create challenges
* 1% to users who burn their Miners NFTs
* 1% to users who burn their Founders NFTs
* 8% to users who provide liquidity to the official swapping pool
* 5% to users who lock their QFT tokens
* 4% to users who use (burn) their QFT to get Credits
* 5% to the Team for project expenses
* 10% to founders

Since the percentage for each area is fixed, and the QFT issue is also known in advance, the base number of tokens for each area can be accurately calculated for a given week. The only variable that is not known in advance is the amount of QFT that will be returned to circulation after Credits have been purchased, but in the early years this amount will be tiny.

#### Deflationary mining

Deflationary mining concept (the article will follow) assumes that users who add value to the system are periodically rewarded with respect to their contribution (during the period) by the issuance of the token with the limited total supply. This way such users are considered miners, and it is assumed that tokens could be obtained through mining only. To add to such a mining deflationary flavor there should be a way to burn tokens for some valuable product of the system.

In relation to Questfall project this concept applies as such:

* Questfall Token (QFT) total supply is 10 000 000, which is issued weekly by decreasing portions. The amount of QFT that will be issued any particular week could be calculated by the formula. There is no pre-minting of the QFT, which means that the only way to obtain newly issued QFT is through mining.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

* QFTs issued each week are distributed with respect to contribution to those who has brought value to the system during the week. This means that QFT can be obtained as a reward for certain valuable actions without having to buy it.

* By burning QFT any author can obtain off-chain system Credits (at a fixed USD price), which can be used for the quest promotion to the platform users. This means that after some market saturation period the circulating supply of QFT will steadily decline.
