# ðŸ’¸ Deflationary tokenomics

When new tokens are issued, they take value from the holders, whereas burning tokens redistributes value to the remaining token holders. And while everyone will want to get newly printed tokens for free, burning without compensation leads to losses and is undesirable unless the user is an altruist who adds value to others at the expense of self-interest. Therefore, to make burning tokens attractive, users should receive some value from the system in return.

In Questfall, those users who burns QFTs will receive Credits (at a fixed price of $1), which in turn can be burned by authors to promote their quests or by users to gain humanity without completing challenges. This way, on the one hand QFT tokens will be issued every week, and on the other hand they will be simultaneously burned for Credits. Such dialectics has several advantages.

Firstly, the circulating supply of QFT will initially raise, since in the beginning there will not be any QFT tokens in existence, but after market saturation the number of circulating tokens will slowly decrease over time. That means that the price of QFT will raise in the long term even if the demand from the existing Questfall users, that want to get an edge on the platform, remains constant. This makes QFT tokenomics very different from any non-deflationary approach, which is essentially a Ponzi scheme, as old investors can only cash out at the expense of newcomers.

Secondary, the raise of QFT price because of new incoming money from investors makes mining more profitable attracting as a result new users to quest activity and infrastructure support.

Thirdly, QFT price volatility does not affect third-party projects who wants to promote their quests to Questfall audience since Credits needed for that have a fixed price in dollars. So, if someone wants to spend some stablecoins for promoting he will get the same number of Credits independent of the price of QFT. The price changes of QFT will only affect miners who will obtain different number of Credits for their QFTs.

Fourthly, since QFT price will trend up in the long term the number of Credits (and as a result the value that can be obtained from the system) for one QFT token will grow over time. This is exactly how deflation works - the longer a consumer waits the more value he will receive for the same amount of money.

Fifthly, in case of QFT price drop the number of tokens that are burned will increase, since to obtain the same number of Credits, more QFTs should be burned. This leads to a rapid trend reversal due to a shrinking circulating supply.

To resume, deflationary tokenomics is much healthier than any other approach and is built on the idea that those earn who waits. But for tokens to burn there should be some value that system provides. The main value that people will be willing to pay for in Questfall is the access to the audience.
