# ðŸŒ² - Real-world quests

When rewards are global the users are paid by the system and not by projects or other users. This means that anyone has a tool to make a world a better place. For example, our Team will create the ongoing quest "Plant a tree" from very beginning.&#x20;

Moreover, global rewards and nonbinary quests will allow to order any intellectual work such as illustrations, animations, videos, music, design, code and so on.

In addition to this, we will implement in the future versions of Questfall local quests, which will allow to find a needed worker (such as babysitter, maid, builder, gardener, pool cleaner, etc...) for your task near you.
