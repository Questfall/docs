description: Questfall Tokens (QFT) can only be mined by providing value to the system.

# ⚒️ Mining approach

Mining means that tokens are periodically issued in decreasing amounts according to a pre-defined formula and are used to reward users in proportion to the value they add to the system during that period.&#x20;

This approach was first implemented in bitcoin and became very successful. The key success factor was the direct link between investment in the cryptocurrency and the development of the bitcoin network. If high demand for a particular stock on the stock market only allows the founders of a company to cash out with a profit or speculators to make money, the high price of bitcoin ensures the profitability of mining, attracting new participants and making the network more secure.

Unfortunately, due to the threat of Sybil attacks, mining has not progressed much beyond the Proof of Work consensus.

Nowadays, teams prefer to mint all the tokens for themselves at once and then sell them to the crowd. Of course, this approach does not make the system healthier or fairer.
{% endhint %}

Since Questfall has solid anti-bot protection, it can afford to use a mining approach that rewards people for adding value to the system. To achieve this, a portion of Questfall Tokens (QFT) are issued each week, and the system uses these tokens to reward users in different areas according to the value they create.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [QFT tokenomics](../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md) is described in detail in another article, for now we just want to emphasize that every QFT token is mined - none are pre-minted by the Team.
{% endhint %}

There is no way to compare the creation of a quest and the provision of liquidity to the DEX pool, so the issue is divided into pre-determined shares between different areas. This can be thought of as different mining pools that have their own fixed percentage of the issue, where users compete with each other by providing comparable value.

In Questfall, 66% of the weekly issue is used to reward quest mining:

* 40% to users who complete quests,
* 10% to authors who create quests,
* 6% to authors who create challenges,
* 10% to seasonal reward pool.

The remaining 34% is used to reward infrastructure support:

* 2% to users who burn their Miners NFTs or Founders NFTs,
* 8% to users who provide liquidity to the official DEX pool,
* 5% to users who freeze their QFT tokens,
* 4% to users who burn their QFT tokens to get Credits,
* 5% to the Team for project expenses,
* 10% to Founders.

The principles by which the value contributed by users is valued can vary from one area to another. For example, liquidity providers receive rewards based on their share of the pool, while the authors' share of rewards is based on quest ratings and popularity.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
While user shares are easy to determine in most areas, one of the key aspects that works against Sybil attacks is that the quest power of users who complete quests is calculated in such a way that it is more profitable to put effort into one account. This makes multi-accounting a losing strategy. See the [Quest completion](../weekly-qft-issue/quest-completion-40.md) article for more details.
{% endhint %}

Since the percentage split is fixed, and the QFT issue is also known in advance, the number of tokens for each area can be accurately calculated for a given week.
