# ⚒️ Mining approach

Mining means that tokens are periodically issued in decreasing amounts according to a pre-defined formula, and are used to reward users in proportion to the value they add to the system during that period. This approach was first implemented in Bitcoin, but unfortunately it has not progressed much beyond the Proof of Work consensus due to Sybil attacks.

{% hint style="info" %}
Nowadays, teams prefer to mint all the tokens for themselves at once and then sell them to the crowd. Of course, this approach does not make the system healthier or fairer.
{% endhint %}

Since Questfall has solid anti-bot protection, it can afford to use a mining approach that rewards people for adding value to the system. To achieve this, a portion of Questfall Tokens (QFT) are issued each week, and the system uses these tokens to reward users in different areas according to the value they create.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [QFT tokenomics](../tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md) is described in detail in another article, for now we just want to emphasise that every QFT token is mined - none are pre-minted by the team.
{% endhint %}

There is no way to compare the creation of a quest and the provision of liquidity to the exchange pool, so the issue is divided into pre-determined shares between different areas. This can be thought of as different mining pools that have their own fixed percentage of the issue, where users compete with each other by providing comparable value.

In Questfall, 66% of the weekly issue is used to reward quest mining:

* [40% to users who complete quests](../weekly-qft-rewards/quest-completion-40.md),
* [10% to authors who create quests](../weekly-qft-rewards/quest-creation-10.md),
* [6% to authors who create challenges](../weekly-qft-rewards/challenge-creation-6.md),
* [10% to seasonal reward pool](../weekly-qft-rewards/season-rewards-10.md).

The remaining 34% will be rewarded for adding value to the infrastructure:

* [2% to users who burn their Miners NFTs or Founders NFTs](../weekly-qft-rewards/nft-burning-2.md),
* [8% to users who provide liquidity to the official DEX pool](../weekly-qft-rewards/liquidity-providers-8.md),
* [5% to users who freeze their QFT tokens](../weekly-qft-rewards/qft-freezing-5.md),
* [4% to users who burn their QFT tokens to get Credits](../weekly-qft-rewards/qft-burning-4.md),
* [5% to the Team for project expenses](../weekly-qft-rewards/project-expenses-5.md),
* [10% to Founders](../weekly-qft-rewards/founders-revenue-10.md).

The principles of reward distribution can vary from area to area. For example, liquidity providers receive rewards based on their share of the pool, while the authors' share of rewards is based on quest ratings and popularity.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The detailed description of each area can be found in the [Weekly QFT Rewards](broken-reference) section of this documentation.
{% endhint %}

Since the percentage split is fixed, and the QFT issue is also known in advance, it would seem that the number of tokens for each area can be accurately calculated for a given week, but this is not the case as Questfall uses Deflationary Tokenomics, which adds some more detail.
