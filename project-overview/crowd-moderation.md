# ðŸ‘Œ - Crowd moderation

Our Team has created many quests on different popular platforms, and we always wanted to push the answers checking to somebody else. In Questfall any author will be able to let the miners (common users) verify the completions of the quest.

This will not only allow miners to earn, but it will also solve any possible automation problem. For example, the cost of Tweeter API is very overpriced, but users can see a particular post for free. So, for author there will be no difference between if the server checked the action on Tweeter or the crowd.
