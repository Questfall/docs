# âœ¨ Quest mining

Mining is a concept where users are rewarded by the issuance of a token in proportion to the value they add to the system. This approach was first implemented in Bitcoin, but unfortunately it has not been taken any further than the Proof of Work consensus. And the main reason for that is Sybil attacks, simply put, bots and multi-accounts that allow abuse of the system.

There have been many attempts in recent years to implement different approaches to proving that a user is human - from various KYC systems with anonymous NFTs to all sorts of pedometers and clickers. However, none of these approaches have been successful because they all can be circumvented, giving the bot farmers an advantage.

So, it's no surprise that all the existing quest platforms have a huge number of bots and multi-accounts, making them virtually useless for the majority of users.&#x20;

Our goal is to make Questfall the first quest platform without bots and multi-accounts, where people can actually earn money by quest mining, i.e. creating and completing quests. To achieve this, we have built the project concept around two main approaches: [Sybil Attack Defense](../#sybil-attack-defense) and [Deflationary Tokenomics](deflationary-tokenomics.md).
