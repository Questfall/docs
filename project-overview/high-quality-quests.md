# ðŸ’¡ - High quality quest

Most projects on the existing quest platform do not put a lot of resources in the quest creation, and the majority of quests are dumb tasks to join Discord or repost a Tweet. But this is not how things should be!

On Questfall all the quests will have a rating which will be considered as a mining power for calculating rewards for authors for the quests they have created. And the more public will appreciate the quest the higher will be the reward for its author.&#x20;

This approach will allow authors to receive a reward for publishing their books, articles, lessons, music, images, videos and so on. Quests like "Read a new chapter of my book and answer a question" could become a new paradigm to earn by creating intellectual products in the modern economy.
