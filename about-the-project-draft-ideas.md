# About the project (draft ideas)

The last couple of years we were working hard on the Elysium Blockchain. The blockchain itself is a very complex system which includes not only code but also society interactions and psychology aspects. That is why we consider blockchains as one of the most complex IT systems in existence.

The core of any blockchain consists of the tokenomics, Sybil attack defense and consensus. In Elysium we managed to separate Sybil defense from the consensus through RPG user levels. The idea is that users can level up by doing quests. So, the quest mechanics will be in the heart of Elysium blockchain.

To test this part in practice (since blockchain code very difficult to alter after it is up and running) we started Questfall project, that will include all social aspects (tokenomics, RPG levels, quests) developed for Elysium.&#x20;

There are many active quest platforms at the moment, and we have heavily used them for our community. But at the end we decided to abandon them since they have unbearable drawbacks, the most crucial of which are absence of the Sybil defense and poor tokenomics. It results in bots' flood and uncertain rewards for quest completion.

In our vision the perfect quest platform should be built as a complex social and technology system (almost like blockchain) - not just as quest-centric online service. And this is what Questfall about: it is like a blockchain, but quest platform.
