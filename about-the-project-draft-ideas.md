# About the project (draft ideas)

Over the past few years, our team has been working hard on the Elysium blockchain, which, like any other blockchain, is a complex system involving not only code, but also human interaction, implying various psychological aspects. This inseparable combination of social and technological factors makes blockchain, according to many experts, one of the most complex IT systems in the world.

The social aspect of any blockchain consists of tokenomics and consensus. However, upon closer examination, it appears that the canonical Proof of Work consensus includes the Sybil defence. In Elysium, we have successfully decoupled the Sybil defence from the consensus through the use of RPG user levels. The idea is that users can level up by completing quests.

Testing and fine-tuning blockchain code after it has been deployed is challenging due to the need for nodes to communicate using the same protocol. In many cases, significant changes to blockchain result in a hard fork because the new version of node software cannot communicate with the previous one. The Questfall project was initiated to test the functionality of social parts, including tokenomics, RPG levels and quests, in a real-world setting.

But it is difficult to test and fine tune blockchain code after it is up and running, because there are many nodes that should communicate the same protocol. In many cases the major changes in blockchain result in hard fork, since the new version of node software can't communicate to the previous one. So, one of the reasons we started Questfall project is to test society parts that were developed for the blockchain (tokenomics, RPG levels, quests) in practice.&#x20;

Another reason to develop Questfall is that all existing quest platforms have significant weaknesses, the most crucial of which are the lack of a Sybil defence and poor tokenomics. This results in an overwhelming number of bots and uncertain rewards for users who do quests. We have first-hand experience of this, having tried to assemble a decentralised group of real people as a pool of initial validators for Elysium.

Our vision is that all problems could be solved if the quest platform were treated as a complex social and technology system (similar to blockchain) rather than just as a quest-centric online service. This is what Questfall is all about: it is like blockchain, only a quest platform. We believe this is the only way to achieve a perfect quest platform.
