# About the project (draft ideas)

The last couple of years our Team was working hard on the Elysium Blockchain. The blockchain itself is a very complex system which includes not only the code but also society interactions and psychological aspects. This is why many consider blockchain to be one of the most complex IT systems in existence.

The core of any blockchain consists of the tokenomics, Sybil attack defense and consensus. In Elysium we managed to separate Sybil defense from the consensus through RPG user levels. The idea is that users can level up by doing quests. So, the quest mechanics will be in the heart of Elysium blockchain.

But it is difficult to test and fine tune blockchain code after it is up and running, since there are many nodes that should communicate the same protocol. In many cases the major changes in blockchain result in hard fork, since the new version of nodes can't communicate to the previous one. So, one of the reasons we started Questfall project is to test society parts that we developed for the blockchain (tokenomics, RPG levels, quests) in practice.&#x20;

Another reason to develop Questfall is that all existing quest platforms have unbearable drawbacks, the most crucial of which are absence of the Sybil defense and poor tokenomics. It results in bots' flood and uncertain rewards for users who do quests. We've seen this firsthand, trying to assemble a decentralized group of real people as a pool of initial validators for Elysium.

In our vision the perfect quest platform should be built as a complex social and technology system (almost like blockchain) - not just as quest-centric online service. That's what Questfall is all about: it's like blockchain, only a quest platform.
