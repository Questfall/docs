# Majority Wins

One of the unique features of Questfall is its completely
decentralized moderation which allows the community to decide the
validity of quest completions and reports. This system allows
anyone to participate in moderation and by design is still
protected from abuse.

Moderating provides users with the **energy** that is needed for
**leveling (XP)** and **quest promotion**. As moderation is the
primary and only free source of energy there will always be enough
users willing to do it.
