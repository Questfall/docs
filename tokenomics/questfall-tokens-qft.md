# ðŸª™ - Questfall Tokens (QFT)

QFT token:\
1\. No allocations, can only be mined through activities on the Questfall platform\
2\. Reward pool shared on weekly checkpoints between Creators, Users, Validators, Staking, Founders \
3\. Reward Pool = QFT issuance + QFT income\
4\. The QFT issuance decreases with each checkpoint. The decay rate is fixed to 1% for example\


Token utility:\
1\. Can be swapped for XP points to create quests on the platform\
2\. Can be staked as a user to gain extra mining power(multiplier)\
3\. Can be staked a validator \
4\. Can be staked as an investor and share a % of the QFT distribution



My take on token dynamics \
1\. Max supply: ? \
I personally want a bigger supply because of the psychological impact. Working a whole month to receive fractions of QFT will not look good. We say the QFT price will be higher in this case but still how much can 0.5 QFT be worth? It'll have to be in the hundreds. I would rather hold 100 QFT worth 10$ than 1 QFT worth 10$ \
The psychological impact is way bigger in this case. For example if i hold 100 QFT with a price of 0.1$ then making gains seemd a lot more realistic. 100% gain it's only 0.2$ . \
In the other case if i hold 1 QFT worth 10$ then making 100% gain seems unlikely. \
Another plus of bigger supply is Market CAP.  We can get in the top 500 projects a lot easier by having a larger mcap.\
\
My advice is to make the supply 100M \
Weekly issuing starting at 300k with a decay rate of 1.5% checkpoint\
\
If we only have 100 creators, 1000 users and 300 validators then without calculating any extra multiplier each will receive QFT in the hundreds. \
the more users we get the more it will dilute. \
Now imagine we get 10k active users\
If the max supply is 1-10M the dilution will be something like 0.0001  and we cannot guarantee the price will offset the dilution.\

#### Deflationary mining

Deflationary mining concept (the article will follow) assumes that users who add value to the system are periodically rewarded with respect to their contribution (during the period) by the issuance of the token with the limited total supply. This way such users are considered miners, and it is assumed that tokens could be obtained through mining only. To add to such a mining deflationary flavor there should be a way to burn tokens for some valuable product of the system.

In relation to Questfall project this concept applies as such:

* Questfall Token (QFT) total supply is 10 000 000, which is issued weekly by decreasing portions. The amount of QFT that will be issued any particular week could be calculated by the formula. There is no pre-minting of the QFT, which means that the only way to obtain newly issued QFT is through mining.&#x20;

* QFTs issued each week are distributed with respect to contribution to those who has brought value to the system during the week. This means that QFT can be obtained as a reward for certain valuable actions without having to buy it.

* By burning QFT any author can obtain off-chain system Credits (at a fixed USD price), which can be used for the quest promotion to the platform users. This means that after some market saturation period the circulating supply of QFT will steadily decline.
