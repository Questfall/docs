# Liquidity Program (5%)

In order for investors to buy Questfall Token (QFT) or for miners to cash out their earnings by selling their QFTs without significant price impact, sufficient liquidity is required.

However, with the mining approach, it is impossible to build liquidity before token issuance begins. Furthermore, there is no fair mechanism for attracting liquidity until the initial circulating supply is formed and the market is saturated.&#x20;

Therefore, the Liquidity Program in Questfall is more than just rewarding users who keep their capital in the Liquidity Pool to cover their impermanent losses. It assumes that users are rewarded not only for adding liquidity to the official Uniswap QFT-USDC pool, but also for burning ownership of the LP tokens they receive.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For short, we will use the term _**liquidity burning**_ to refer to the addition of liquidity followed by the burning of LP ownership. This approach was first introduced by the [Core project](https://medium.com/@CORE_Vault/introducing-core-fef3e1b77d12).
{% endhint %}

Users will receive 5% of the weekly QFT issuance according to their share of the burnt liquidity during the week. This way, if users provide too little liquidity during the week, the reward will not only compensate the cost, but also bring profits, creating and arbitrage opportunity. In other words, on average, liquidity will increase each week by the total value of 5% of that week's QFT issuance.

For example, if the price of a QFT is $10 and the weekly issuance is 30,000 QFTs, the total reward to Liquidity Program participants will be $15,000, which may seem too small. However, over the course of a year, assuming the price of QFTs and issuance remain the same, the total increase in liquidity will be $780,000. And if the QFT price doubles, the dollar estimate of liquidity growth will also double.

To further increase the rate at which liquidity grows, there will be an additional reward to incentivize the burning of liquidity - Toolsets that allow users to increase the rarity tier of clothing RPG items.

{% hint style="info" %}
The mathematics of the distribution mechanism of the Toolsets is quite complex, and we will publish it after we have tested it in code. For now, we just describe the general approach.
{% endhint %}

Users will increase their chances of getting more rare Toolsets, depending on their total share of burnt liquidity during the week. However, since the number of Toolsets issued each week depends on the number of users who have burned liquidity, there will be a threshold for adding liquidity to prevent Sybil attacks.

This way, depending on the price of Toolsets of different tiers on the secondary market, users will add more liquidity than the total weekly QFT reward for Liquidity Program. And in our estimation, Toolsets will increase the amount of liquidity burned by orders of magnitude.

In this way, the more activity in the system, the higher the demand for Toolsets, the more their price will rise, and the faster liquidity will grow, since the Liquidity Program rewards are the only way to release Toolsets into circulation.

As a result, the Liquidity Program encourages the infinite organic growth of liquidity through an endless stream of weekly rewards, eliminating any possibility of manipulation or rug-pulling by anyone, including the Team.
