# QFT burning (4%)

QFTs can be burned for Gold, which in turn can be used by authors to promote their quests, and by users to buy from the marketplace and increase their level with XP (By converting first to Silver). To increase the number of tokens burned, 4% of the newly created QFTs will be used each week to reward users who burn their QFTs for Gold during that week.

This approach creates an arbitrage by ensuring that if less than 4% of the weekly token creation is burned during a week, there is an opportunity to burn QFTs and return more than that as a reward. In effect, 4% of the weekly token creation becomes a floor that guarantees a minimum amount of QFT burned per week.&#x20;

Meanwhile, for Gold, users receive value (quest promotion, trading or XP) from the system, which implies burning more than 4% of the weekly token creation.
