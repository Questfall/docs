# Referral Program (5%)

We consider marketing as one of the most important factors for the success of any project, especially in the case of Questfall, where the tokenomics is mainly based on user activity. While most of the mechanics described in this documentation are aimed at user retention, the Questfall Referral Program is aimed at attracting new users.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Questfall Referral Program is not affiliated with IFE, which has its own referral program.
{% endhint %}

The referral program works as follows: each user who registers in the system using a referral code will initially receive 10% more Silver when burning Gold. Each week this Silver bonus will decrease by 1% until the system price of 10 Silver per Gold is reached after 2.5 months (10 weeks).

Ambassadors whose codes are used by other users to sign up will receive a share of the referral reward pool at the end of the week, based on the amount of [Gold](../assets/gold-in-game.md) their referrals burned during the week.

{% hint style="info" %}
When a user pays Gold into the system, 10% of that Gold goes into the weekly referral reward pool, while the remaining 90% is burned.
{% endhint %}

This way, Ambassadors can earn an endless stream based on actual user actions that add value to the entire community simply by posting about Questfall. And because Gold is dollar-based, Ambassador earnings are not affected by the price of QFT.

Since Gold is an in-game currency, Ambassadors will need to withdraw Gold from the system to the chain, and there are two mechanics for doing so. Directly through the weekly system auction, where users can exchange Gold for QFT at a price that depends on the competition in the auction. The other way is through NFT crafting and trading.

{% hint style="info" %}
We have considered using a portion of the weekly QFT issue to reward Ambassadors, but there is no way to create an endless fair income stream with this approach.
{% endhint %}

As a result, Questfall Ambassadors will have to immerse themselves in the details of Questfall to be able to withdraw their earnings and will become much more involved and informed. This way, they will not be just influencers looking for quick money (which we can still easily buy), but real evangelists of the project who will ensure the long-term information support of Questfall.
