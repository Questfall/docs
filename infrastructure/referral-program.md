# Referral Program

We consider marketing as one of the most important factors for the success of any project, especially in the case of Questfall, where the tokenomics is mainly based on user activity. While most of the mechanics described in this documentation are aimed at user retention, the Questfall Referral Program is aimed at attracting new users.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Questfall Referral Program is not affiliated with IFE, which has its own referral program.
{% endhint %}

The referral program works as follows. Any user who uses a referral code to register in the system will receive enough [Silver ](../assets/Silver-in-game.md)to level up from level 1 to level 5. The Questfall Ambassador whose referral code was used by the user will receive 1% of all [Gold ](../assets/gold-in-game.md)the user will ever burn.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the user who used the referral code to sign up burns Gold, 99% is actually burned, while 1% is transferred to the Ambassador.
{% endhint %}

This way, Ambassadors can earn an endless stream based on actual user actions that add value to the entire community simply by posting about Questfall. And because Gold is dollar-based, Ambassador earnings are not affected by the price of QFT.

However, Ambassadors will have to withdraw Gold from the system to the chain, and there are two mechanics for doing so. Directly through the weekly system auction, where users can exchange Gold for QFT at a price that depends on the competition in the auction. The other way is through NFT crafting and trading.

{% hint style="info" %}
We have considered using a portion of the weekly QFT issue to reward Ambassadors, but there is no way to create an endless fair income stream with this approach.
{% endhint %}

As a result, Questfall Ambassadors will have to immerse themselves in the details of Questfall to be able to withdraw their earnings and will become much more involved and informed. They will not only be influencers who ask for money (which we can still easily buy), but real evangelists of the project who will ensure the long-term information support of Questfall.
