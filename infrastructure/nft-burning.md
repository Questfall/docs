# NFT burning (1%)

Our goal is to maximise the price of [Founder NFTs](../assets/founders-nft.md) over the long term. To achieve this, 1% of the newly created QFTs are allocated each week to purchase them from the market via auction, with the subsequent burning of these NFTs.

There will be one auction each week for the Founder NFTs. In the auction, the system will use 1% of the weekly token creation to buy back Founders NFTs offered by users. User bids will be ranked according to the price of one point of the Founder NFT.

Bought NFTs will be burned and the remaining QFTs allocated for buyback will be carried over to the next week. This means that if user bids are too high this week and the system is unable to buy even one point from the NFT, the amount allocated for buyback will be increased at the next auction. After several such accumulations, the system is guaranteed to meet user bids.

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to the limitations of smart contracts, the maximum number of offers that can be filled each week is 50.
{% endhint %}

The buyback and burning of NFTs will begin shortly before the launch of Questfall and will continue until there are no NFTs left in circulation. This will not only ensure that the price of NFTs rises in the long term but will also increase the share of the weekly reward for each Founder who does not burn their [Founder Points](../assets/founder-nfts.md).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In fact, the last owners of each type of NFT will be able to get as many QFTs as they are willing to wait for, as the amount the system will offer for burning NFTs will increase each week.
{% endhint %}
