# Marketplace

Many crypto projects consider popular third-party marketplaces such as OpenSea as a means of attracting an audience and selling their NFTs. Unlike this approach, the marketplace in Questfall is not just a convenient way for miners to trade RPG items.

It plays a crucial role in the overall mechanic as a means of extracting value from the system through NFT trading, and is a necessary piece needed for various user strategies based on crafting and trading.

The main idea behind item trading in Questfall is that there are actually two marketplaces: one for in-game trading of low rarity items (F,E,D) with Gold, and another for on-chain trading of higher rarity items (C,B,A) as NFTs with QFT.

Two different marketplaces are brought together under one interface.

This approach allows the value of in-game gold to be extracted onto the blockchain by crafting higher rarity items and selling those items as NFTs on the chain. For example, a user can use Gold to purchase an item and a Toolset, both of rarity D, and then consume the Toolset to evolve the item to rarity C, which can be withdrawn as an NFT and sold on the marketplace for QFT.

In both marketplaces, 5% of the item price is burned as a fee - Gold is burned for lower rarity items, while QFT is burned for higher rarity items. This 5% is automatically added to the amount of money a seller wants to receive, forming a final price that buyers see.

There is a good chance that we will implement auction-based pricing for both marketplaces in future versions of Questfall.

Since items listed on the in-game marketplace are taken from inventory, the marketplace can be used as storage space, making the inventory weight limit meaningless. To prevent such abuse, there is a finite number of marketplace slots for lower-tier items that are traded for Gold.&#x20;

A first level character has 3 marketplace slots. The number of slots available can be further increased by adding attribute points to the character's Crafting attribute - each additional slot requires an additional 5 points in Crafting.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
In other words, additional slots will open up when Crafting reaches 5, then 10, 15, and so on.
{% endhint %}

In summary, the entire marketplace mechanic in Questfall is heavily tied to the RPG system as well as the project's tokenomics, and thus plays an important role in the mining process, making it much more personal, engaging, and dependent on the results of the work of others.
