# Project Expenses (5%)

The long-term success of any project depends heavily on how it evolves and adapts to the changing world. Therefore, it is very important to have enough resources not only to maintain the project, but also to improve it.

In order to ensure the long-term sustainability of Questfall, 5% of the weekly QFT issue will be rewarded to the Team, to be used at their discretion, depending on the current situation, to cover necessary costs in three crucial areas:

* staff salaries;
* hardware rent;
* advertising and marketing.

In the beginning, the Team will cover the project support and development costs with the money raised through the [IFE](../roadmap/initial-funding-events.md). This may be enough for a year or two. However, in the long run, [Deflationary Mining](../overview/deflationary-mining.md) should do its magic and 5% of the QFT issue should be sufficient to cover all costs.

{% hint style="info" %}
We understand the obligations that come with such an approach and will act in the best interest of the entire community.
{% endhint %}

It is important to note that we have enough experience in the business to learn the importance of separating company and personal money. Therefore, when we talk about the money the Team gets (either via IFE or as a weekly QFT reward), we do not associate it with our personal income as individuals.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
We have Founder NFTs for that.
{% endhint %}

This means, for example, that if 5% is too much money that the Team doesn't really need, we will use the excess funds to, for example, increase the Liquidity Program reward or buy back and burn Founder NFTs. Both of these actions will increase our earnings as founders.

While these statements may seem unlikely in the crypto space, it is a common practice in the real world. And it is the healthiest approach in the long run.
{% endhint %}

This separation of personal and company money makes us, as founders, interested in exchanging the Team's QFT without selling it directly into the liquidity pool, as we will suffer the negative effects of such actions just like any other founder, miner, or QFT holder. And there could be many solutions to this problem.

For example, the Team may have direct connections with people in our community who can pay for the servers in exchange for the QFT reward with a bonus. Or the QFTs of the Team can be used as an event reward when there is a need for marketing activities, instead of paying influencers with the stablecoins. Or QFTs can simply be sold OTC to founders at a discount.

As a result, we separate ourselves from the Team, which at some point may only consist of hired staff, and do everything in our long-term best interest as founders, and that interest is the same as for every other participant of Questfall - the highest possible QFT price.
