# Gold Withdrawals (8%)

8% of the weekly QFT issue goes to the users' **Gold Withdrawals**. 

This works through a system auction â€“ the users willing to bid the highest amount of Gold for these QFTs can have it.

This mechanism adds value to Gold and offers another way to turn in-game earnings into real-world value.
