# Completion Retries

### Result of Completion

Each answer submission for a quest is reviewed by the system automatically or by the moderators. If the submission is accepted, the user receives the reward, and the quest is moved from the global quest feed to the completed feed.

If the submission is declined, the base reward of the quest decreases based on the number of retries the author has set for the quest.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if there are a maximum of five retries on a quest, each wrong submission decreases the base reward by 1/5 for the user.
{% endhint %}

A user can try to re-submit an acceptable answer when there are unused retries and the quest is still active.
