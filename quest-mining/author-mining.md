# Author Mining

As can be seen on existing quest platforms, without motivation, authors create quests just to lure the audience to other places with more exclusive interactions. This leads to the majority of quests being of very low quality, like silly tasks to join the Discord community or repost a tweet in X.

On the other hand, rewarding quests that are appreciated by the community create a very different economic situation. Global system rewards, based on the mining concept, allow authors to earn without direct sales by providing content to the community in the form of quests.

The content provided in the form of a quest can be anything: books, articles, lessons, music, pictures, videos and so on.
{% endhint %}

To encourage authors to create quality content in the form of quests, 10% of the newly created QFTs will be distributed each week to reward creators based on the popularity and rating of their quests.



Since the ordering of quests in the global feed depends primarily on the number of Quest Points, a high reputation of authors will ensure high visibility (and as a consequence, popularity) of his quests.

Each quest has an end date when it closes. At the end of the week, the system will collect all quests that have ended during the week and calculate each quest's Mining Power as the product of the quest completions and the quest's rating.

Since quest completion is moderated by the community, and quest ratings are based on a "majority wins" voting, there is no way for malicious authors to abuse the system by creating a large number of pointless quests.
