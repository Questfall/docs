# Overview

Although we wrote in the [Sybil Defense](../overview/sybil-defence.md) article that mining in Questfall consists of two main activities, this was done for simplicity, as there are actually three complementary activities that make Quest Mining possible:

* [Quest Creation](quest-creation-10/)\
  authors earn weekly and seasonal rewards by creating quests;
* [Quest Completion](quest-completion-40/)\
  users earn weekly and seasonal rewards by completing quests;
* [Community Moderation](community-moderation/)\
  allows users to level up or promote their own quests.

{% hint style="info" %}
These activities are open to everyone, so a user can create a quest, complete quests from the feed, and moderate completions all in one day.
{% endhint %}

Quest completion and quest creation produce different types of value that cannot be compared. These two activities also rely on different core mechanics. While quest completion relies heavily on the individual [mining power](quest-completion-40/mining-power.md), quest creation relies on [author reputation](quest-creation-10/author-reputation.md).

For this reason, there are two separate reward pools each week and season: one for users who complete quests and one for authors who create them. These pools are formed using 66% of the weekly QFT issue:

* 10% (weekly) + 3.2% (seasonal) to authors who create quests;
* 40% (weekly) + 12.8% (seasonal) to users who complete quests.

{% hint style="info" %}
While the weekly reward pool is distributed immediately upon QFT release, the [Seasonal Reward Pool](seasons-16.md) is distributed at the end of the season.
{% endhint %}

While quest completion and quest creation create two separate groups of competitors for QFT issuance, community moderation allows users to earn [Silver](../assets/Silver-in-game.md), which can be issued in any amount, but cannot be withdrawn and can only be used to improve the mining results of the first two activities.

As a result, each of the three main mining activities in Questfall offers different rewards and relies on completely different reward distribution mechanics.&#x20;
