# Author Spaces

While many creators like to work alone, there are also many situations where content is produced by an entire team of different specialists.

For this reason, although we use the word "authors" throughout this documentation, quests do not actually belong to any particular user account, but rather to the Author Space, which serves as a collaborative environment for creating and managing quests.

{% hint style="info" %}
Author Space also serves as an author profile that is visible to all users.
{% endhint %}

Each user in Questfall can only create one Author Space and automatically becomes its owner. However, since Author Spaces implement the role-based permissions model, owners can define different roles with custom permissions and invite other users. Therefore, users can be part of an unlimited number of spaces to which they have been invited.

<table><thead><tr><th width="133">Roles</th><th width="546">Permissions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Owner</td><td><ul><li>Deposit Silver to Author Space balance</li><li>Claim and withdraw QFT rewards received by Author Space</li><li>Define roles and the permissions associated with them</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Assignable</td><td><ul><li>Create quest drafts</li><li>Publish quests from drafts by spending Silver on the Base Reward</li><li>Purchase banner promotion slots with Silver</li><li>Edit the Author Space design and description</li><li>Assign roles and invite users</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

Such an approach can, if necessary, simulate the workflow of a magazine newsroom. The owner can focus only on costs and profits, while hired users can handle all content-related tasks.

{% hint style="info" %}
Author Spaces have Silver balances separate from their owners, and once deposited, Silver can only be used for quest or banner promotions and cannot be withdrawn. This is required in order to implement user donations to their favorite authors in [future versions](../../roadmap/future-versions.md) of Questfall.
{% endhint %}

To make it easier to navigate, the quests in the Author Space are divided into four different groups based on their status:

* **Drafts.** Drafts of quests that have not yet been published. Every new quest is saved as a draft first.
* **Active.** Published quests that users can complete for a reward. Each active quest has an end date.
* **Banned.** Published quests that have been reported and then banned by community moderation.
* **Ended.** Quests that have been deactivated because they have successfully reached an end date.
