# Author Spaces

**Author Space** is the profile and workspace for the individual author or project. So for the author to be able to start to create quests, first they need to set up their author space.

Within the author space, users can manage all the necessary things related to authors like creating quests, reviewing submitted answers, seeing the stats, or claiming earned author rewards. Also, it works as a profile page where users can find the author's quests, follow him, and know all the relevant information about the author.

{% hint style="info" %}
A user can be the creator of only one author space but can be part of an unlimited amount by invitation. Like when a team or company wants to manage its official Questfall author space, many users can have the rights to use it and create quests for it.
{% endhint %}

### Roles

The creator of the author's space gets the role of an owner and can give two types of roles to other users for managing the space:

1. **Owner** – Has full access and rights to the author space.
2. **Admin** – Has limited access to the author space. The owners can modify the rights of admins for example by allowing them only to edit and publish quests they have created.

### Quest Creation

Within the author's space users can create and publish quests. The creation of a new quest is a two-part process:

1. First users fill in all the relevant information about the quest like cover image, instructions, and submission types, and then save it as a draft.
2. This draft can be deployed after the user has chosen the duration of the quest and the amount of Silver to burn for promotion.

{% hint style="info" %}
Authors need to carefully check all the information in the quest as after publishing it can no longer be edited.
{% endhint %}

***

### Quest Sorting

Within the author space, all the created quests are sorted in four ways:

* **Drafts** – Quests that users of author space have completed as drafts but haven’t published. Every new quest is first saved as a draft.
* **Active** – Published quests that haven’t ended or reported. Here the author can see the remaining duration of published quests.
* **Reported** – All the quests published by the author space that have been reported. The falsely reported and those removed from the quest feed can be found in this section.
* **Ended** – Quests that have ended. Here the author can find all the accepted submitted answers on his quests.

### Result of Completion

Each answer submission for a quest is reviewed by the system automatically or by the moderators. If the submission is accepted, the user receives the reward, and the quest is moved from the global quest feed to the completed feed.

If the submission is declined, the base reward of the quest decreases based on the number of retries the author has set for the quest.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if there are a maximum of five retries on a quest, each wrong submission decreases the base reward by 1/5 for the user.
{% endhint %}

A user can try to re-submit an acceptable answer when there are unused retries and the quest is still active.

***

### Special Rewards

Through promotion, the author can increase the base reward of their quests to make them more appealing to users. Additionally, authors can set a **Special Reward** of QFT or Gold for those users who mine the most points exclusively with the author's quests.

The special reward can attract users to compete for the rewards resulting in many completions on the author's quests.

For this purpose, each author space has a leaderboard showing the users who have gained the most mining points from the author's quests on a reward period.

***

### Assets and Donation

Each author space has a QFT, Gold, and Silver balances that can be used for special rewards and to promote the created quests. The owners can freely deposit any amount of these assets to the author's space and withdraw QFT and Gold. Silver can be only used within the author's space for promotion and can’t be withdrawn or donated.

Users other than the creator can **Donate Assets** to the author space to increase the Silver balance. The donation allows project members and common users to support the space. Donated QFTs and Gold are immediately burned to Silver.

{% hint style="info" %}
Personal resources can be used directly for promotion by the quest creator without manually moving the assets to the author space first.
{% endhint %}





To make the platform a safe and enjoyable environment, users can report quests seen as inappropriate or breaking the server rules.

Users can be motivated to report quests not only cause of their goodwill but also because of a Silver reward. The system rewards users for valid reports and punishes them for wrong ones.

The reporting of quests works as follows:

1. The user reports a quest they consider breaking the server rules.
2. This report goes to moderators for voting. Reported quests are prioritized over every other moderation for fast results.
3. Moderators vote yes/no if this quest breaks server rules and should be removed from the platform. If the majority (weighted by user level) vote yes, the quest is removed, the reporter earns a Silver reward, and the quest creator is punished heavily. If moderators vote no, the reporter loses Silver. Moderators earn by voting with the majority.

To prevent abusing of the reporting system, only users above a certain level can report quests on the platform.
