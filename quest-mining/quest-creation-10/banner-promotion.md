# Banner Promotion

### Banner Promotion

Within the Questfall platform, two **Marketing Banners** are visible for all users â€“ one for the team to promote collaborations, and another for author spaces to promote themselves. Promoting the author space this way can make it known to the community and increase the number of followers and quest completions.

Author spaces can buy with Silver or Gold a one-day slot for featuring them on the banner. There are available slots on sale only for the next 30 days.

The prices of the one-day slots increase exponentially the farther we go from the current day. This guarantees there are always author spaces willing to pay the price for featuring as the price for the current day is so low.

As the demand for banner promotion grows, the author spaces are willing to pay more and buy days further in the future to make sure to get a spot. There is no limitation to how many one-day spots a single author space can buy.

To ensure no inappropriate author spaces are promoted users above a certain level can report the banner. Reported banners are voted by the moderators and rewarded in the same way as [Reported Quests](broken-reference).
