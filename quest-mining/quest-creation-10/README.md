# Quest Creation (10%)

Existing quest platforms require authors to spend resources to reward users for completing quests. Questfall, on the other hand, rewards users for completing quests on behalf of the system. On top of that, authors are rewarded with 10% of the weekly [QFT](../../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md) issue for creating popular quests.

This creates a new authoring paradigm that coexists with the current one. While some teams can still use money to promote their quests to the Questfall audience, other authors may earn from their creativity without any investment.

Authors' creativity is limited only by their imagination. However, the forms in which quests can be completed are limited because the system must ensure that users have actually performed the required actions. Therefore, there are predefined types of quests in Questfall, each with its own kind of completion.

{% hint style="info" %}
New quest types will be implemented as Questfall evolves.
{% endhint %}

The first group of quests have the same correct answers for everyone and can therefore be validated instantly by the system without community moderation. These quests are inexpensive in terms of system load, and therefore may allow multiple attempts to complete them.

* **Text.** A user must enter text that is evaluated against one or more predefined correct answers.
* **Quiz.** A user has to choose between several options, one of which is secretly the correct one.
* **Survey.** A user must select one of the options, each of which is considered correct.

The second group requires [community moderation](../community-moderation/) for each completion and therefore only allows one attempt to complete the quest, as such an approach places a heavy load on the system in terms of moderator work.

* **Link.** A user must perform an action on a third-party platform and provide a link and screenshot for moderation.
* **Transaction.** A user must provide a link and screenshot of a specific transaction in the given blockchain.

The number of completions a quest generates is directly affected by its position in the [Quest Feed](../../overview/global-feed.md), which is ordered by the quest's reward. In other words, to make a popular quest, an author should put a large [Base Reward](base-reward.md) in the quest.

{% hint style="info" %}
Of course, the reward is not the only factor people rely on when choosing a quest to complete. It just makes sure that users notice the quest.
{% endhint %}

As a result, authors will compete with each other for users' attention through the quest's Base Reward, which can only be obtained by burning [Silver](../../assets/Silver-in-game.md).

Since Silver can be earned by participating in community moderation, authors are not forced to pay for quest promotion with money. However, the price of each point of Base Reward increases exponentially because it is capped, while competition can dramatically increase the amount of Silver spent on quest promotion.

In order to provide an advantage to authors who create quests that the community values, Questfall implements the concept of [Author Reputation](author-reputation.md), which provides a 10% discount for each point of reputation when paying for the Base Reward with Silver.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
An author with a reputation of 9 will get a 90% discount, while an author with a reputation of 1 will only get a 10% discount. This means that the first author will need 9 times less Silver for the same amount of Base Reward in the quest.
{% endhint %}

Since the reputation is directly affected by the ratings of the author quests,&#x20;
