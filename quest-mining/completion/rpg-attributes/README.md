# RPG Attributes

The common RPG approach assumes that users are represented by a character that becomes more powerful by investing stat points gained with each new level into pre-defined character attributes.

Questfall uses the same mechanic - users gain one stat point per [level](../levels.md) and can use it to improve any of the following attributes:

* [Inventory](inventory.md): increases the weight limit of stored items;
* [Mining](mining.md): increases Mining Power and Stamina Reserve;
* [Crafting](crafting.md): increases efficiency when working with Essence or Gems;
* [Trading](trading.md): reduces marketplace fee, gives advantage on Gold withdrawal, adds marketplace slots;
* [Recovery](recovery.md): increases Stamina Reserve recovery rate;
* [Luck](luck.md): increases chance of getting missing chest shards and other bonuses, adds loot box turns.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are at least two more attributes waiting to be implemented in [future versions](../../../roadmap/future-versions.md) of Questfall: Magic and Warfare.
{% endhint %}

Because users can allocate stat points to any attribute, they can focus on certain areas and gain specific benefits in those areas, customizing a character to fit their individual mining strategy.

Of course, users can make mistakes as their characters evolve, so when users join a new [league](../leagues.md), they can redistribute attribute points once for free.&#x20;

However, any subsequent redistribution within that league will cost a certain amount of [Gold](../../../assets/gold.md), depending on the league. For example, in League I the cost is 1000 Gold ($10), in League II it is 2000 ($20), and so on.

{% hint style="info" %}
While the Hall is considered a tutorial and there is no cost to redistribute attribute points, for the actual league it is calculated by the formula:\
$$Cost_{gold}=1000*League_{count}$$
{% endhint %}
