# Weekly Rewards

### Reward for challenge creation

For a solid defense against Sybil attacks, the number of challenges in the system should be sufficient in relation to the total number of users. To achieve this, any user can create a challenge, which becomes active once it has been approved by the community. The system will distribute 2% of the newly created QFTs each week to reward authors whose challenges are accepted during that week.

Also, users should be motivated to create interesting and engaging challenges. To maintain quality, an additional 4% of the newly created QFTs will be distributed each week to authors who created challenges in previous weeks, based on the ranking of their challenges.

As the user vote is not applied to the challenge rating until the user's completion of the challenge has been approved by the community, bots and multi-accounts will not be able to abuse the challenge rating.

To keep the system self-cleaning, 5% of the lowest rated challenges will be removed each week. This means that authors who create high quality challenges will continue to earn passive income for an unlimited period of time, while low quality challenges will be removed, and their authors will no longer receive weekly rewards.

### Rewards for quest creation

As can be seen on existing quest platforms, without motivation, authors create quests just to lure the audience to other places with more exclusive interactions. This leads to the majority of quests being of very low quality, like silly tasks to join the Discord community or repost a tweet in X.

On the other hand, rewarding quests that are appreciated by the community create a very different economic situation. Global system rewards, based on the mining concept, allow authors to earn without direct sales by providing content to the community in the form of quests.

The content provided in the form of a quest can be anything: books, articles, lessons, music, pictures, videos and so on.
{% endhint %}

To encourage authors to create quality content in the form of quests, 10% of the newly created QFTs will be distributed each week to reward creators based on the popularity and rating of their quests.



Since the ordering of quests in the global feed depends primarily on the number of Quest Points, a high reputation of authors will ensure high visibility (and as a consequence, popularity) of his quests.

Each quest has an end date when it closes. At the end of the week, the system will collect all quests that have ended during the week and calculate each quest's Mining Power as the product of the quest completions and the quest's rating.

Since quest completion is moderated by the community, and quest ratings are based on a "majority wins" voting, there is no way for malicious authors to abuse the system by creating a large number of pointless quests.

### Rewards for quest completion

Rewarding quest completion by ordinary users is at the core of the quest mining concept, along with quest creation by authors. This is what makes Questfall unique, as QFTs are earned by completing quests, not by buying tokens.

That is why the biggest part equal to 40% of the weekly QFT issue is used to reward users for completing quests.&#x20;

To prevent abuse of the system by bots or multi-accounts, the distribution of rewards to users who complete quests is calculated using a few simple rules.

1. Users receive a number of Quest Points for each quest they complete, based on the author's Karma and the number of Credits the author of the quest has burned to promote it.
2. Quest Points the user receives are adjusted by the user's level, Humanity and Mining NFT (if any) to calculate Mining Power the user obtains for completing that particular quest.&#x20;
3. The fixed number of QFT tokens that can be calculated in advance for any given week is distributed to users based on their share of the total Mining Power earned by all users during the current week.

This way Quest Points earned by users are individual for each author or even each quest if it is promoted but are the same for all users who completes the same quest. On the other hand, these default amount of Quest Points for a particular quest is just the base for calculation of Mining Power which depends on individual user parameters (level, Humanity, Mining NFT).
