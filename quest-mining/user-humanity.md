# User Humanity

To protect the system from abuse, every user in Questfall should spend 5 Humanity to complete a quest and 1 Humanity to vote. If a user does not have enough Humanity, he should earn it first by completing challenges.

Challenges are a special type of quest where the answer depends on the account. For example, writing "New York" backwards is a bad challenge because it has the same answer for every account, whereas writing the username backwards will give individual answers and as a result is a good challenge.

During pre-moderation voting by the community, each challenge is assigned a difficulty level that affects the amount of Humanity users receive for completing it.

Another way to gain Humanity is by burning [Challenge NFT](../assets/challenge-nft.md), which can be obtained through QFT burning for $5 and gives the same amount of Humanity as the middle difficulty challenge (+40).&#x20;
