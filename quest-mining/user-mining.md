# User Mining

Rewarding quest completion by ordinary users is at the core of the quest mining concept, along with quest creation by authors. This is what makes Questfall unique, as QFTs are earned by completing quests, not by buying tokens.

That is why the biggest part equal to 40% of the weekly QFT issue is used to reward users for completing quests.&#x20;

To prevent abuse of the system by bots or multi-accounts, the distribution of rewards to users who complete quests is calculated using a few simple rules.

1. Users receive a number of Quest Points for each quest they complete, based on the author's Karma and the number of Credits the author of the quest has burned to promote it.
2. Quest Points the user receives are adjusted by the user's level, Humanity and Mining NFT (if any) to calculate Mining Power the user obtains for completing that particular quest.&#x20;
3. The fixed number of QFT tokens that can be calculated in advance for any given week is distributed to users based on their share of the total Mining Power earned by all users during the current week.

This way Quest Points earned by users are individual for each author or even each quest if it is promoted but are the same for all users who completes the same quest. On the other hand, these default amount of Quest Points for a particular quest is just the base for calculation of Mining Power which depends on individual user parameters (level, Humanity, Mining NFT).
