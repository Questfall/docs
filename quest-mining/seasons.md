## Seasons

While the concept of mining is fair enough on its own, platforms like Questfall (where users create value for others) offer additional rewards for the most loyal and engaged users, as this encourages long-term audience retention and therefore value.

To achieve this, 16% of the newly created QFTs will be placed each week in the **Seasonal Reward Pool**, from which **11.2%** will be distributed each season to **Users** with the highest mining score.

{% hint style="info" %}
A common season will last three months (twelve weeks), during which a fund of approximately 120% of average weekly token creation will be collected. By rewarding only the most engaged users, the system will ensure that they receive a noticeable reward.
{% endhint %}

This approach also allows for seasonal collaborations with other projects, which not only brings additional rewards to users, but also encourages QFT burning, as to become a Questfall Season Partner, a third-party team must burn QFT.



### Seasons

Each week, 16% of the total weekly issue of QFT goes to the **Seasonal Reward Pool**, and **4.8%** of this will be distributed as a reward to the most dedicated authors.

At the end of a **Season**, accumulated QFT reward is offered to a handful of authors valued by the community and those dedicated to perfecting their craft of quest creation. The authors who have collected the most author points during the 3-month long season will receive a reward at the end of the season.

As the reward accumulates over time, almost 60% of the average weekly token issue is rewarded to the most successful authors.
