# Incentives

#### Votes are rewarded or penalized

If users can only be rewarded and not punished for voting, then any kind of blind or random voting will be a profitable strategy that can be automated. And as a result, users will be able to level many accounts at once through bots. This will completely break the system.

Therefore, in Questfall, moderators will be rewarded or penalized with [Silver](../../assets/Silver-in-game.md) based on how their vote matches the final consensus. If it matches, the moderator is rewarded. If it does not, the moderator is penalized.

{% hint style="info" %}
In some cases, league-based segmentation penalizes the majority, as shown in the table above.
{% endhint %}

This approach, where the user can either be rewarded or punished, affects the way moderators will evaluate the voting topic. They will be forced to judge it from the perspective of the majority, not from their personal point of view. Of course, if they want to earn Silver and not lose it.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, you may not personally like a story that a user has written. However, you think that the majority will like it. How would you vote?
{% endhint %}

It is also important to note that users can have a negative Silver balance, so that new moderators can make mistakes that can be fixed without paying. This way, new users can practice their moderation skills, go negative, and then earn Silver back with proper voting.

## Rewards and punisments

Moderation is the primary and only free source of **Silver** which is needed for XP and quest promotion.

The Silver Reward for voting with or against the majority is unique for each type of moderation:

* Witness +10/0
* Approve 0/-20
* Reported Quests +10/-20 (also for the reporter)

As the system assignes moderations randomly in re-defined portions, each user must moderate all types. To increase the Silver count, the user must be able to vote with the majority on all different types of moderation. Guessing the right answers is a losing strategy as the average penalty for wrong answers is double the reward for the right answers.

The user receives the reward or punishment when the moderation is fully settled. Usually this takes from minutes to hours.

#### Banning a user after many failures

The ability to have an unlimited negative Silver balance assumes that users can vote wrongly infinitely. They will not earn anything, as this will completely wipe out the Silver balance, making an account a waste. However, it is a threat. An attacker can train AI this way, or just add entropy and load to the system.

To prevent this, Questfall has a 24 hour ban for every additional -1,000 in negative Silver balance. In other words, the user will be banned for 24 hours when his Silver balance reaches -1,000, another ban will be applied when the balance reaches -2,000, but this time it will be 48 hours. A 72 hour ban will be applied when the balance reaches -3,000. And so on.

This way, if a moderator uses any kind of automated voting that is not successful in the majority of cases, he will either have to face increasing bans or gain Silver through QFT burning to cover the negative balance, or use many first level accounts that have no weight in the system.
