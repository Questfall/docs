# Incentives

{% hint style="info" %}
This article only discusses community voting incentives. Punishments or rewards for users based on moderation results (e.g., punishing the author of a reported quest that moderators deem malicious) are described in the appropriate articles.

### Internal Completions

Questfall is designed to allow users to create quests that require actions on third party platforms, and it is expected that the majority of quest completions will be in the form of external content.&#x20;

However, as the platform develops, it is very likely that some basic content will be implemented directly into the system in [future versions](../../roadmap/future-versions.md) of Questfall.

{% hint style="info" %}
This will allow users to use Questfall like a generative AI, for example, asking the crowd to create a certain picture or solve a math problem.
{% endhint %}

These internal completions published on Questfall itself will be immutable, meaning that the system ensures that they can't be edited after submission.

<table><thead><tr><th width="130">Moderator</th><th width="110" align="center">Incentive</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reward</td><td align="center">+6 Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Penalty</td><td align="center">-16 Silver</td></tr><tr><td>Bypass</td><td align="center">-2 Silver</td></tr></tbody></table>

### External Completions

External completions, since their content can be changed at any moment by the author, are divided into two voting topics: witnessing screenshot and judging completion.

{% hint style="info" %}
Learn more in the [Witnessing](witnessing.md) article.
{% endhint %}

As a result witnessing allows to earn Silver while judging allows not to lose it. And for protecting the system from abusing bypassing the cost of bypass is defined so it is more&#x20;
