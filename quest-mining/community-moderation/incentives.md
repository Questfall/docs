# Incentives

To prevent the majority&#x20;

## Rewards and punisments

Moderation is the primary and only free source of **Silver** which is needed for XP and quest promotion.

The Silver Reward for voting with or against the majority is unique for each type of moderation:

* Witness +10/0
* Approve 0/-20
* Reported Quests +10/-20 (also for the reporter)

As the system assignes moderations randomly in re-defined portions, each user must moderate all types. To increase the Silver count, the user must be able to vote with the majority on all different types of moderation. Guessing the right answers is a losing strategy as the average penalty for wrong answers is double the reward for the right answers.

The user receives the reward or punishment when the moderation is fully settled. Usually this takes from minutes to hours.

#### Quest Report

To make the platform a safe and enjoyable environment, users can report quests seen as inappropriate or breaking the server rules.

Users can be motivated to report quests not only cause of their goodwill but also because of a Silver reward. The system rewards users for valid reports and punishes them for wrong ones.

The reporting of quests works as follows:

1. The user reports a quest they consider breaking the server rules.
2. This report goes to moderators for voting. Reported quests are prioritized over every other moderation for fast results.
3. Moderators vote yes/no if this quest breaks server rules and should be removed from the platform. If the majority (weighted by user level) vote yes, the quest is removed, the reporter earns a Silver reward, and the quest creator is punished heavily. If moderators vote no, the reporter loses Silver. Moderators earn by voting with the majority.

To prevent abusing of the reporting system, only users above a certain level can report quests on the platform.
