# Quest Completions

## Types of voting

There are **three types of moderation** in the system.

### Witnessing

Users vote if the link content is equal to the screenshot provided by the user completing the quest.

This is the first step of making sure the quest completion is valid. Witnessing is needed to make sure that there is unchangeable information to vote for in the approving state.

### Approving

Users vote if the quest is done correctly.

Based on the completion terms and extra information provided by the author moderators vote if the quest should be accepted or declined.

### Reported Quests or Completions

Users vote if the reported quest or completion breaks community rules.

Reported quests or completions go to moderation only if there are enough reports in it. The reporters either win or lose silver based on the moderation voting result. If a reported quest or completion is voted to be against the community rules the user responsible for it gets a high penalty.



## Rewards and punisments

Moderation is the primary and only free source of **Silver** which is needed for XP and quest promotion.

The Silver Reward for voting with or against the majority is unique for each type of moderation:

* Witness +10/0
* Approve 0/-20
* Reported Quests +10/-20 (also for the reporter)

As the system assignes moderations randomly in re-defined portions, each user must moderate all types. To increase the Silver count, the user must be able to vote with the majority on all different types of moderation. Guessing the right answers is a losing strategy as the average penalty for wrong answers is double the reward for the right answers.

The user receives the reward or punishment when the moderation is fully settled. Usually this takes from minutes to hours.
