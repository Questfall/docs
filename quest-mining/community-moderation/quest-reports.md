# Quest Reports

### Reporting of Quests

To make the platform a safe and enjoyable environment, users can report quests seen as inappropriate or breaking the server rules.

Users can be motivated to report quests not only cause of their goodwill but also because of a Silver reward. The system rewards users for valid reports and punishes them for wrong ones.

The reporting of quests works as follows:

1. The user reports a quest they consider breaking the server rules.
2. This report goes to moderators for voting. Reported quests are prioritized over every other moderation for fast results.
3. Moderators vote yes/no if this quest breaks server rules and should be removed from the platform. If the majority (weighted by user level) vote yes, the quest is removed, the reporter earns a Silver reward, and the quest creator is punished heavily. If moderators vote no, the reporter loses Silver. Moderators earn by voting with the majority.

To prevent abusing of the reporting system, only users above a certain level can report quests on the platform.
