# Community Moderation

As noted in the [Sybil Defense](../../overview/sybil-defence.md) article, computers can't properly judge quest completions because:

* completions can be any kind of content,
* completions must implement unpredictable quest requirements,
* completions must meet minimum quality criteria that are entirely a matter of human perception,
* completions can be published on any available platform on the Internet, most of which fight against automated access to prevent DDoS attacks and content scraping.

In addition to judging content, computers are very bad at risk assessment, especially when it comes to the outside world, since risk assessment in many cases is heavily based on social reputation.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, what are the chances that Youtube will drain your crypto wallet? To the computer, however, youtube.com is just another website because it can't take into account its social reputation or your personal experience.
{% endhint %}

For this reason, Questfall relies entirely on the help of its users to solve such problems, which is implemented in the form of community [consensus](consensus.md) through voting, or in other words, community moderation. It protects the system and its users from abuse by censoring three types of entities:&#x20;

* [Domains](incentives.md#domains),&#x20;
* [Quests](incentives.md#quests),&#x20;
* [Completions](incentives.md#completions).

This makes community moderation a crucial part of the platform - it helps to distribute fair rewards to miners according to their efforts, and also protects Questfall users from scams.&#x20;

Therefore, voting must be protected from any kind of manipulation, multi-accounts, bots, and blind/random voting.

Addressing all of these threats automatically results in a solid defense against Sybil attacks

The main principle of securing the community moderation voting is that moderators are rewarded or penalized with [Silver](https://docs.questfall.xyz/assets/silver-in-game) , depending on how their vote matches the final consensus. If it matches, the moderator is rewarded. If it does not, the moderator is penalized.

{% hint style="info" %}
Aside from directly burning [Gold](../../assets/gold-in-game.md) or [QFT](../../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md), community moderation is the only way to earn Silver by adding value to the entire community through proper voting.

Apparently, the [incentives](https://docs.questfall.xyz/quest-mining/community-moderation/incentives) are balanced so that, on average, the penalties of random or blind voting outweigh the rewards, making it a losing strategy.

In addition, if moderators can be punished, they will be forced to vote from the point of view of the majority, rather than from their own personal point of view.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, you may not personally like a movie, but you think that the majority will like it. How would you vote?
