# Community Moderation

Moderating activity in Questfall is an important part of the platform, as it helps define fair rewards for miners based on the quality of their quest completions. This is a very hard problem for computers to solve, so moderation also serves as a [defense against Sybil attacks](../../overview/sybil-defence.md), which is very important for keeping mining fair.

Completions of many types of quests are very hard to estimate algorithmically, because they can be of any kind of content on any availble platform in the internet. Not only the quality of completion should met some minimum requierments to quality, which is entirely the question of human perception, but also popular platforms such as X, Facebook or Youtube fight with automatic access to prevent DDoS attacks and content scarping.



## Majority wins

One of the Questfall's unique features is its completely decentralized **Moderation** which allows the community to decide the validity of quest completions and reports. This system allows anyone to participate in moderation and is, by design, is still protected from abuse.

Moderating provides users with the **Silver** needed for **Leveling (XP)** and **Quest Promotion**. As moderation is the primary and only free source of silver, there will always be enough users willing to do it.

The moderation voting is designed in a way that it rewards real users and penalizes those trying to abuse or automate the system.

## Binary Voting

The System uses a **Binary Voting** - each moderation is voted on using the binary options yes/no. The votes have different weights and a winning majority is calculated based on the vote weights.

Users who voted with the majority are rewarded with Silver and those who voted with the minority lose or do not get Silver.

The weight of a user's vote is directly correlated to his level and increases by one with each level. This makes it impossible for many new accounts to be registered and used to manipulate voting results.

high-level users, who are most interested in the platform's stability and success, have a great deal of influence in moderation.
