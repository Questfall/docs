# Community Moderation

As noted in the [Sybil Defense](../../overview/sybil-defence.md) article, computers can't properly judge quest completions because:

* completions can be any kind of content,
* completions must implement unpredictable quest requirements,
* completions must meet minimum quality criteria that are entirely a matter of human perception,
* completions can be published on any available platform on the Internet, most of which fight against automated access to prevent DDoS attacks and content scraping.

In addition to judging content, computers are very bad at risk assessment, especially when it comes to the outside world, since risk assessment in many cases is heavily based on social reputation.

For example, what are the chances that Youtube will drain your crypto wallet? To the computer, however, youtube.com is just another website because it can't take into account its social reputation or your personal experience.

For this reason, Questall relies entirely on the help of its users to solve such problems, which is implemented in the form of community consensus through voting, or in other words, community moderation.

Community moderation protects the system and its users from abuse through the moderation of three types of entities:

* **Domains**. External links in Questfall have warnings, except for trustworthy sites that have been whitelisted by the community.
* **Quests**. Quests can be dangerous, so they can be reported by users and banned by the community with penalties for the author.
* **Completions**. Completions that cannot be automatically verified by the system are validated by the community. In addition, moderators can report a completion if it is dangerous to other moderators.

This makes community moderation a crucial part of the overall operation of the platform - it not only helps to distribute fair rewards to miners according to their efforts, but also protects Questfall users from scams.

However, for community voting to work, the consensus must be protected from all kinds of manipulation, multi-accounts, bots, and blind/random voting. This is achieved through rules and incentives designed so that the most profitable strategy for a moderator is to play by the rules. Addressing all of these threats automatically results in a solid defense against Sybil attacks.
