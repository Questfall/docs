# System Fakes

## System fakes

Along with the real problems that need moderation system generates **Fakes**, that should not pass moderation.

With fakes, the system keeps a balance by providing users with different types of moderation and an equal amount of right/wrong answers. This prevents users from succeeding by accepting every moderation, as the majority of real submissions are expected to be acceptable answers.

Users can't choose specific items to vote on when moderating as the system assigns them randomly and bypassing a moderation costs Silver. This prevents the same automated vote from being cast from many accounts.

Since the system knows what should be the correct vote it can punish malicious voters and reward good ones independent of who is the majority. In other words, such fakes are used as honeypots.

In fake moderation, the quest information is mixed in such a way that humans can recognize it being a non-valid completion but bots canâ€™t.
