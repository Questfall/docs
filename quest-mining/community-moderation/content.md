#### **Users should not be able to punish good moderators**

In many cases, moderators would need to vote on some content outside of Questfall, for instance a post on Facebook. Content on such third-party platforms can be edited by the author at any time, so a user can submit a completion and then change it while it is being moderated. As a result, the consensus result should change on the fly.

This may even happen without malice. For example, there may have been a mistake initially, and a user fixed it later, after moderation had begun. In this case, the first moderators who voted that the completion was invalid would be punished for doing their job correctly, which is obviously not fair.

However, if there is no punishment, then the principle of "votes should result in rewards or penalties" is violated.&#x20;

This contradiction is resolved by splitting a single voting topic into two. To do this, the system should ask the user for two things: a link to the quest completion, and a screenshot of the completion.

As a result, the moderation process for such a completion could be split into two steps. First, one set of moderators would vote to approve that the screenshot represents the actual completion. We call this stage witnessing.&#x20;

And then another set of moderators (since this will be a different voting topic) will judge whether or not the quest is completed based on the approved screenshot, which could not be altered.

The key is that the reward and penalty should also be split in such a way that screenshot witnessing allows moderators to earn, while completion judging allows them not to lose. This way, witnessing can't be penalized, and a user won't be able to punish good moderators by altering content.

While these two votes are assigned to different moderators, there will be many such completions, meaning that the system would be able to balance such split topics for each moderator individually over many iterations.
