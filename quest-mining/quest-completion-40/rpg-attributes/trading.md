# Trading

The Trading attribute gives an advantage to users who have chosen a trading strategy that involves buying and selling RPG items on the marketplace for gaining Gold or QFT. As a result, this attribute gives bonuses not only for trading itself, but also for withdrawing Gold on the system's weekly auction.

### Marketplace Slots

Since the [marketplace](../../../infrastructure/marketplace.md) can be used to overcome the inventory weight limit by listing RPG items on the marketplace at very high prices that no one is willing to pay, there is a limit to how many items a user can list for sale on the marketplace.

{% hint style="info" %}
Higher rarity items can always be taken out of inventory as NFTs, but this will cost [a certain amount](../rpg-items/) of Gold.
{% endhint %}

A first level character starts with 1 marketplace slot, and each additional point in the Trading attribute grants a new slot.

{% hint style="info" %}
The number of available slots is calculated using the following formula:\
$$Slots=Trading+1$$
{% endhint %}
