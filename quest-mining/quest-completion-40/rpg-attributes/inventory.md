# Inventory

Users store their unused RPG items in their inventory, which can hold any number of items, but has a weight limit.

If a user's inventory is overloaded, the user will not be able to perform actions that result in the acquisition of new items, such as opening loot boxes, making purchases from the in-game marketplace, or bringing in an item from NFT.

The weight limit of the newly created character is 1 kg, and it can be further increased by adding more attribute points to the Inventory attribute - each point increases the limit by 1 kg.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the Inventory attribute has 15 points, the weight limit will be 15 kg.
{% endhint %}

Users are motivated to increase their inventory weight limit not only to keep more items, but also because as a level increases, a user will have more rare and high level items, which weigh more.

{% hint style="info" %}
The weight of each item is directly affected by its rarity and level, and can be calculated using the following formula: \
$$Weight_{item}=10*Level_{item}*Rarity_{item}$$
{% endhint %}

For example, a level 1 common (F) item weighs 10 grams. While the same item of level 10 will weight 100 grams. The 20 level Epic (C) item will weight 800 grams.
