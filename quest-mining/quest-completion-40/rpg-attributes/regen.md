# Regen

increases Stamina Reserve recovery rate;



Another crucial parameter that affects a character's **Stamina Reserve** is the speed of its recovery. Initially, when the **Regeneration** attribute equals 1, the character restores <mark style="background-color:purple;">0.2</mark> stamina per minute. With each additional point in **Regeneration**, the amount of stamina restored per minute increases by <mark style="background-color:purple;">0.2</mark>.

{% hint style="info" %}
When the Regeneration attribute is 20, a character recovers 4 stamina per minute.
{% endhint %}

As in most other RPGs, stamina can be restored instantly at any time with the Stamina Potion, which can be obtained from the loot box or purchased with **Gold** from other users in the marketplace.
