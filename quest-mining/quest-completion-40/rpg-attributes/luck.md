# Luck

increases chance of getting missing chest shards and other bonuses, adds loot box cards.



### Bonus Chances

Many activities in Questfall offer a chance to receive bonuses or reduce costs, such as:

* Earning 2x **Essence** when disassembling an item;
* Receiving 2 **Chest Shards** as a quest reward;
* Earning 2x **Mining Points** as a quest reward;
* Getting 2x chances to win when attacking on warfare map;
* Spending only half the **Essence** to level up or evolve an item;
* Spending only half the mana on a spell;
* Using only half the stamina for a quest;
* And many more...

Initially, the chance to win a bonus is <mark style="background-color:purple;">11</mark> in <mark style="background-color:purple;">1010</mark>. Each point of **Luck** increases the chance of winning by <mark style="background-color:purple;">1</mark> and the chance of losing by <mark style="background-color:purple;">10</mark>. Although it seems contradictory, in fact, with each point of **Luck** the probability of getting a bonus will increase from initial \~1% to unattainable maximum of 10%.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if **Luck** is 10 the chances of getting the bonus will be 20/1100=1.8%, while with **Luck** 50 the chance will raise to: 60/1500=4%.
{% endhint %}
