# Levels

### Character Level

One of the most important character parameters is level. While users start as a level 1 character, they can level up by acquiring **XP** either through proper moderation (by voting with the majority) or by paying directly with **Gold** into the system.

A character's level is defined by two numbers: the level itself and the amount of **XP** required to advance to the next level. Although the level cannot be lowered, the amount of **XP** required to reach the next level can be increased if the user is penalized for going against the majority.

For example, the **XP** required for the next level increases if the user's vote is in the minority on a particular quest completion, or if the user reports a quest that the community agrees is appropriate, and so on.
{% endhint %}

Leveling up provides several benefits to a user. As the level increases, so does the weight of a user's vote in community moderation decisions. Level also determines the league in which the user is placed, meaning that a higher-level user can mine with less competition. Finally, with each level, a user receives <mark style="background-color:purple;">2</mark> attribute points that can be used to upgrade the character.

### Silver and Level

For the user to gain **XP** and progress through levels they need **Silver**, which can be acquired from moderation, and by burning Gold.

Silver can be traded for XP within an individualized XP pool that resets every week. The trading works with the same principles as an automated market maker (AMM), the Silver price of XP increases the more XP is bought in the same week. And of course, the XP canâ€™t be traded back to Silver.
