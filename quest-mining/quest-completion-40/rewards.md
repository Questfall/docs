# Rewards

The **Leagues** allow a fair sharing of rewards and prevent bots and multi-accounts from taking the reward of real dedicated users.

Mining points earned during a week result in a mining score, which is reset at the end of each week after rewards are distributed according to each user's share of the total mining score.

The **40% weekly miners reward** is shared equally with each league with active users. The user has to compete for the weekly QFT reward only with users in the same league. As entering a higher league takes more effort than a lower one, the number of users competing for the same reward decreases with each league.

The user's weekly **QFT reward** is based on the **league level** and **Mining Score**.

{% hint style="info" %}
If there were only four leagues with active users, each league would have 10% of the weekly QFT reward to share. Each user would earn a portion of this 10% based on their mining score relative to the total number of points mined in that league.
{% endhint %}

In addition to having less competition in a higher league, the users can be motivated to get to a new league for a free attribute reset. When a user joins a new league, he can redistribute the character's attribute points once for free and thus re-design their game approach.
