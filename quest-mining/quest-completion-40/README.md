# Quest Completion (40%)

In Questfall, users will not have to grind quests for nothing or wait for rewards that will never arrive. The [mining approach](broken-reference), combined with [deflationary tokenomics](../../overview/token-burning.md), allows ordinary users to be generously rewarded by the system, not other users, for their efforts in completing quests with [QFT](../../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md).&#x20;

Since quest completion is considered the most important activity on the platform, the largest portion of the weekly QFT issue (40%) is distributed evenly among the leagues, where users compete against each other based on their mining score earned by completing quests during the week.

{% hint style="info" %}
In fact, more than half of the weekly QFT issue is used to reward users for completing quests, as an additional 11.2% is transferred to the seasonal reward pool each week. However, [seasons](../seasons-14.md) are reviewed separately as they use a completely different approach to reward distribution.
{% endhint %}

As a result, users must perform two types of activities to earn as much as possible by completing quests. First, they must vote correctly in the [community moderation](../community-moderation/) to earn [Silver](../../assets/Silver-in-game.md) and increase their [level](levels.md) to progress through the leagues. Second, they must earn mining points by completing quests throughout the week.

Each quest answer submission is reviewed by either the system or the moderators. If the submission is rejected, a user may resubmit a new variant of an answer if the quest type and author allow for multiple attempts. However, the Bounty for the quest will be reduced based on the number of retries set by the quest author.

If the submission is declined, if the quest type and the author of the quest allow several reties a user can re-submit a new variant of an answer. However, the Bounty of the quest will decrease based on the number of retries the author has set for the quest.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if there are a maximum of five retries on a quest, each wrong submission decreases the Bounty by 1/5 for the user.
{% endhint %}

If the submission is accepted, the user is rewarded with the amount of mining points calculated as the product of the [Quest Bounty](../quest-creation-10/quest-bounty.md), which is the same for everyone (except for [unrated quests](../quest-creation-10/karma.md)), and the user's personal mining power. Therefore, if multiple users complete the same quest, they will receive different amounts of mining points as a reward.

{% hint style="info" %}
Mining points earned by completing quests do not simply add up linearly to a mining score. Learn more in the [Rewards](rewards.md) article.
{% endhint %}

Users cannot lose mining points, or in other words, the mining score can only increase during a week as users complete quests. At the end of the week, rewards are distributed according to each user's share of the total mining score, and then individual scores are reset for everyone in the system.

There are many ways for users to increase their individual mining power, as at the heart of the quest mining is the entire RPG system based on the user's representation with a character defined by [attributes](attributes.md) that can be upgraded with points earned at each [level](levels.md).

In addition to attributes, the character can also be equipped with a variety of [clothing](items.md) with different effects that, like attributes, improve other aspects of the user's performance besides mining power.
