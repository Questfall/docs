# Quest Completion (40%)

In Questfall the users donâ€™t need to grind quests for nothing or wait for rewards that will never arrive. The unique reward system and deflationary tokenomics allows ordinary users to be generously rewarded with QFT for their effort in completing quests.

There is no pre-mining of the QFT and the limited total supply of tokens is issued weekly in decreasing amounts determined by a pre-defined formula, and 40% of this QFT weekly issue goes directly to miners.



### Result of Completion

Each answer submission for a quest is reviewed by the system automatically or by the moderators. If the submission is accepted, the user receives the reward, and the quest is moved from the global quest feed to the completed feed.

If the submission is declined, the base reward of the quest decreases based on the number of retries the author has set for the quest.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if there are a maximum of five retries on a quest, each wrong submission decreases the base reward by 1/5 for the user.
{% endhint %}

A user can try to re-submit an acceptable answer when there are unused retries and the quest is still active.



### Quest Sorting

Users can sort the quest feed to display all, followed, marked, hidden, or completed quests.

* **Followed** - The authors can be followed as creators in popular social media platforms. Users can choose to sort the feed to show quests only from those authors they are following.
* **Marked** - The users can mark those quests they see as interesting or important and create and display a feed based on them.
* **Hidden** - Undesirable quests can be hidden from the global feed by the user. Feed can be sorted to display all the hidden quests.
* **Completed** - The completed quests are automatically removed from the global feed and moved to the completed section.
