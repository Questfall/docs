# Quest Completion (40%)

In Questfall the users donâ€™t need to grind quests for nothing or wait for rewards that will never arrive. The unique reward system and deflationary tokenomics allows ordinary users to be generously rewarded with QFT for their effort in completing quests.

There is no pre-mining of the QFT and the limited total supply of tokens is issued weekly in decreasing amounts determined by a pre-defined formula, and 40% of this QFT weekly issue goes directly to miners.
