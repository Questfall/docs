# Quest Completion (40%)

In Questfall the users donâ€™t need to grind quests for nothing or wait for rewards that will never arrive. The unique reward system and deflationary tokenomics allows ordinary users to be generously rewarded with QFT for their effort in completing quests.

There is no pre-mining of the QFT and the limited total supply of tokens is issued weekly in decreasing amounts determined by a pre-defined formula, and 40% of this QFT weekly issue goes directly to miners.



### Result of Completion

Each answer submission for a quest is reviewed by the system automatically or by the moderators. If the submission is accepted, the user receives the reward, and the quest is moved from the global quest feed to the completed feed.

If the submission is declined, the base reward of the quest decreases based on the number of retries the author has set for the quest.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if there are a maximum of five retries on a quest, each wrong submission decreases the base reward by 1/5 for the user.
{% endhint %}

A user can try to re-submit an acceptable answer when there are unused retries and the quest is still active.
