# Attributes

The common RPG approach assumes that users are represented by a character that becomes more powerful by investing stat points gained with each new level into pre-defined character attributes.

Questfall uses the same mechanic - users gain one stat point per [level](../levels.md) and can use it to improve any of the following attributes:

* **Mining**: increases Mining Power and Stamina Reserve;
* **Inventory**: increases the weight limit of stored items;
* **Crafting**: boosts the yield of Essence, gives an advantage when trading and obtaining Gems;
* **Trading**: reduces marketplace fee, gives advantage on Gold withdrawal, adds marketplace slots;
* **Regen**: increases Stamina Reserve recovery rate;
* **Luck**: increases chance of getting missing chest shards and other bonuses, adds loot box cards.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are at least two more attributes waiting to be implemented in [future versions](../../../roadmap/future-versions.md) of Questfall: Magic and Warfare.
{% endhint %}

Because users can allocate stat points to any attribute, they can focus on certain areas and gain specific benefits in those areas, customizing a character to fit their individual mining strategy.

Of course, users can make mistakes as their characters evolve, so when users join a new [league](../leagues.md), they can redistribute attribute points once for free. However, any subsequent redistribution within that league will cost 1000\*LeagueCount amount of [Gold](../../../assets/gold-in-game.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
The Hall is considered a tutorial and there is no cost for redistributing attribute points. In League I the cost is 1000 Gold ($10), in League II it is 2000 ($20), and so on.
{% endhint %}
