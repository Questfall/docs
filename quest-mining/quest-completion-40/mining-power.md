# Mining Power

Quest Rating voting!

To encourage the giving of fair ratings on a quest and to prevent rating manipulation, the user is incentivized to vote close to the **Average Rating**. Users gain or lose a small % of mining efficiency based on how close one voted to the average of all votes. The closer the user votes for the average, the more mining efficiency one gains, and the farther, the likelier it is to get the maximum mining efficiency penalty. If the user votes on the neutral zone the mining efficiency stays unchanged.

{% hint style="info" %}
With each quest voting the user can gain or lose up to 0.2% of mining efficiency.
{% endhint %}

The maximum mining efficiency bonus user can reach by voting is limited based on the level. With each level, the potential maximum mining efficiency bonus increases by 0.1%. Regardless of the level, there is no limit to the negative mining efficiency one can have by voting continuously out of the average.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, level 40 users can have a maximum +4% mining efficiency bonus from voting.\\
{% endhint %}







At the end of each week or season, rewards for completing quests are distributed based on a user's Mining Score, which is simply the total number of Mining Points a user earns by completing quests during that period.

Each quest has a base reward set by the quest author that is the same for everyone, and users who complete the quest will receive a number of Mining Points based on that base reward and their individual Mining Power.

{% hint style="info" %}
Individual Mining Power is based on the [RPG System](../../overview/rpg-system.md).

### Mining Efficiency

By increasing the personal **Mining Efficiency** bonus a user can receive more mining points from each completed quest. The base reward of a quest is multiplied by the mining efficiency % bonus the user has.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the base reward for the quest is 50 mining points and the user has 100% of mining bonus, they receive 100 mining points from completing the quest.
{% endhint %}

Constant mining efficiency bonus can be increased by clothing, elixirs, rating quests, and adding points to the mining attribute. Spells and elixirs can give mining bonuses for a limited time or to a specific quest.
