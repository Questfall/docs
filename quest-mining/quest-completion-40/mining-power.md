# Mining Power

At the end of each week or season, rewards for completing quests are distributed based on a user's Mining Score, which is simply the total number of Mining Points a user earns by completing quests during that period.

Each quest has a base reward set by the quest author that is the same for everyone, and users who complete the quest will receive a number of Mining Points based on that base reward and their individual Mining Power.

{% hint style="info" %}
Individual Mining Power is based on the [RPG System](../../overview/rpg-system.md).

### Mining Efficiency

By increasing the personal **Mining Efficiency** bonus a user can receive more mining points from each completed quest. The base reward of a quest is multiplied by the mining efficiency % bonus the user has.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the base reward for the quest is 50 mining points and the user has 100% of mining bonus, they receive 100 mining points from completing the quest.
{% endhint %}

Constant mining efficiency bonus can be increased by clothing, elixirs, rating quests, and adding points to the mining attribute. Spells and elixirs can give mining bonuses for a limited time or to a specific quest.
