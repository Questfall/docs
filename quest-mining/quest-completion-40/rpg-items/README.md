# RPG Items

{% hint style="info" %}
The weight of each item is directly affected by its rarity and level, and can be calculated using the following formula: \
$$Weight=100*Rarity^2*\sqrt{Level}$$
{% endhint %}





{% hint style="info" %}
Higher rarity items can always be taken out of inventory as NFTs, but this will cost a certain amount of Gold. It costs 100 gold ($1) to withdraw a C item, 300 Gold ($3) to withdraw a B item, and 900 Gold ($9) to withdraw an A item.
{% endhint %}
