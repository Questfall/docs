# Clothing

IMAGE OF INVENTORY WITH ITEMS

There are a variety of in-game **Items** comprising **Clothing**, **Spell Books**, **Elixirs**, and **Potions** which give bonuses to the character and game play.

Items can be acquired from **Loot Boxes** and **Marketplace.**



### Gems

### Clothing Slots

Clothing items are the primary means by which users can improve their characters through the various effects that items contain, from increasing the **Mining Efficiency** to adding more **Spell Slots**. The number of **Clothing Slots** is limited to six for all users and cannot be increased:

* Head (helmets, hoods, hats);
* Chest (robes, tunics, shirts, vests);
* Leg (pants, trousers);
* Feet (boots, shoes);
* Hand (gloves, gauntlets);
* Back (capes, cloaks, mantles).

Although clothing items can be of different levels and rarities, there are no restrictions on equipping them other than type (obviously boots can't be equipped in the hand slot).

However, if the level of the item is higher than the **Character Level**, it will be downgraded (while equipped) to the **Character Level**. Additionally, stamina consumption rises as the total weight of equipped items increases. Finally, each item consumes **Essence** at the moment of equipping - the heavier the item, the more **Essence** is consumed (<mark style="background-color:purple;">0.2</mark> Essence for each gram).

***

### Tier and Level

**Clothing**, **Spell Books** and **Elixirs** comes in six different **Tiers**:

* Common (F)
* Advanced (E)
* Rare (D)
* Legendary (C)
* Epic (B)
* Mythic (A)

The higher the tier of the item the more powerful and heavier it is. In addition to the tier, clothing also has **Level** that affects the item's bonuses.

### Clothing

IMAGE OF CLOTHING

There are multiple types of **Clothing** and the character has six slots to wear them, one for each body part:

* **Head** (helmets, hoods, hats)
* **Chest** (robes, tunics, shirts, vests)
* **Leg** (pants, trousers)
* **Feet** (boots, shoes)
* **Hand** (gloves, gauntlets)
* **Back** (capes, cloaks, mantles)

Wearing clothing provides many benefits to the character, such as bonuses to mining power, attributes, mana or stamina.

The character can wear clothing of any level or tier. If the level of the item is higher than the character level, the item and its effects will be downgraded (while equipped) to the character level while the tier and weight stay the same. The higher the level and tier of the clothing, the greater the bonuses and weight.

All types of clothing can be seen as equal in quality as they give the same amount of bonuses for the same weight. However, every kind of clothing has a unique weight ratio making some items heavier and more powerful than others.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, the weight and effect of pants are three times that of a hat. If (F) level 10 hat weighs 100g and gives 280 mana a pants of the same level and tier would weigh 300g and give 840 mana.
{% endhint %}

Each clothing has a weight ratio from 1 to 4, giving weight to level 1 (F) items from 10 to 40 grams.

The weight of clothing is directly affected by its tier and level, and can be calculated using the following formula: 10 Grams \* Weight Ratio \* Level \* Tier (F = 1, A = 6).

The level and tier of clothing can be upgraded with [Crafting](broken-reference).

### Spell Books

IMAGE OF SPELL BOOK

Users can learn spells from the **Spell Books** by consuming them. For each spell, there are six tiers of spell books.

Spell books do not have a level and the tier can be upgraded.

For more details see [Magic](broken-reference).

### Elixirs

IMAGE OF ELIXIR

The **Elixirs** provide beneficial effects to the character which vary a lot ranging from attribute boosts to reducing the cooldown of all of the character spells.

Consuming an elixir gives either a **temporary** or **permanent** effects.

**Lower-tier elixirs** (F, E, D) give temporary effects.\
**Higher-tier elixirs** (C, B, A) give permanent effects.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are full lines of elixirs that come in all six tiers and others that are unique to only one or a few tiers. For Example, elixir can have only permanent effects like giving an extra marketplace slot.
{% endhint %}

There are four categories of elixirs:

* **Attribute Elixirs** – Increases the base attribute points of the character. Each attribute has one elixir, and these points can’t be redistributed with an attribute reset.
* **Mystic Elixirs** – These affect things related to magic, spells, and mana, like reducing the mana cost of all the character's spells.
* **Power Elixirs** - Gives a boost to the mining power, stamina, and the ability to carry more items, like speeding up the stamina recovery.
* **Fortune Elixirs** – These affect things related to lucky strikes, loot boxes, shards, and trading, like boosting the probability of bonus chances.

**Questfall Elixirs PDF**

Elixirs do not have a level and the tier can't be upgraded.

### Potions

IMAGE OF POTION

There are two different types of **Potions**:

* **Stamina Potions** - Consuming fully replenishes the stamina reserves.
* **Mana Potions** - Consuming fully replenishes the mana reserves.

Potions do not have a tier or level and there is only one size of both types.

***

### Loot Boxes

IMAGE OF LOOT BOX

**Loot Boxes** are the primary source of all **RPG items**. They can be obtained by buying directly from the system for **100 Gold** ($1) each or by collecting a full set of [Chest Shards](broken-reference).

By default, a loot box provides one item, with the chance of it being any type, tier, or level. Users can increase their chances of receiving more items by placing points in the [Luck attribute](broken-reference) and by consuming a specific elixir.

{% hint style="info" %}
The Gold spent on buying loot boxes is automatically burned by the system.
{% endhint %}

The function of a loot box is closer to in-game Gold than items as they do not influence the carried weight or stamina consumption and can be opened without using essence. As the items found in the loot box have weight, the box can’t be opened if the character weight limit is fully used. The loot boxes are individualized for the user and can’t be traded with other users.

### Drop Rates

The items drop rate from a loot box decreases 10 times with each tier. For example, Legendary (C) item is 10 times less likely to drop from a loot box than the same item as Rare (D).

This makes the higher-tier items extremely valuable and hard to find in the loot boxes. If the chance of finding an F-tier clothing is 1 in 10 it makes the chances of finding an A-tier clothing 1 in 1 million.

As finding higher-tier items is so difficult and elixirs and spell books are consumed, the game will never be over-saturated with powerful items.

{% hint style="info" %}
Loot boxes are the only way new items are released into circulation.
{% endhint %}

***

### Marketplace Trading

IMAGE OF QUESTFALL MARKETPLACE

All the users have access to the two **marketplaces** where items can be bought or sold for **Gold** (in-game) and **QFT** (on-chain) between the users.

Marketplace trading of items is directly linked to the character's inventory – All bought items go directly to inventory and those placed on sale are moved from the inventory to the marketplace slots.

### Trading for Gold

In the in-game marketplace the **lower-tier** items F, E, and D are traded for **Gold**.

Each user has a limited number of marketplace slots where lower-tier items can be placed for sale for a chosen fixed Gold price.

{% hint style="info" %}
First-level character starts with 3 Marketplace Slots, and each subsequent Marketplace Slot requires another 5 points of Crafting attribute.
{% endhint %}

### Trading for QFT

In the on-chain marketplace the **higher-tier** items C, B, and A, are traded for **QFT**.

Users can place the higher-tier items on sale to the marketplace directly from the inventory for a fixed price of QFT. Trading on-chain does not use the character's marketplace slots and allows users to place any number of items on sale.

Also, these items can be withdrawn from- and deposited into the inventory as NFTs. For more details about on-chain trading of items see [Marketplace](../../../infrastructure/marketplace.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
As the trading of higher-tier items happens on-chain the user must pay the Polygon gas fee for each transaction.
{% endhint %}

### Marketplace Rules

The marketplace offers free trade between users but there are some rules to both types of trading:

* Every trade has a 5% fee (Gold/QFT) which is burned immediately by the system.
* Items can be traded only for Gold or QFT and can’t be exchanged for other items.
* User can transfer items to inventory (buying or depositing) only if the character can carry its weight.

IMAGE OF CRAFTING

**Crafting** allows users to upgrade **Clothing** with essence and disassemble any item for essence. Also, **Spell Books** can be upgraded by merging them together.

This creates an additional layer of game mechanics and gives users the ability to get an edge by advancing their equipment. Crafting adds value to all types of items in Questfall as any item can be disassembled and used as a source of **Essence**.

***

### Weight and Essence

The item's weight, amount of essence it contains, and tier and level are directly correlated. The heavier the clothing the more essence is needed for upgrading it.

By disassembling any item user gets a percentage of the essence it contains. The number of essences received from disassembling an item can be increased by adding points to the crafting attribute.

For more details about the amounts of essence needed for upgrading and received from disassembling see the [Essence Balance](broken-reference).

Essence is a highly valued resource as in addition to upgrading it is needed to equip and unequip clothing and it can’t be bought or traded.

***

### Clothing Upgrade

The amount of boosts **Clothing** gives depends on its level and tier which can be upgraded by crafting.

Users can freely choose to upgrade either the level or tier of clothing. Any level item can be evolved by tier and any tier item can be increased in level. The cost/benefit ratio is the same with both upgrades but evolving the tier often consumes more essence at one time as it has a greater effect on item bonuses.

All tier of clothing has upgradeable effects that can be leveled up and the higher tier also has non-upgradable effects that can’t be leveled up.

The number of **upgradable** and **non-upgradable** effects is based on the tier:

* 1/0 - Common (F)
* 2/0 - Advanced (E)
* 3/0 - Rare (D)
* 3/1 - Legendary (C)
* 3/2 - Epic (B)
* 3/3 - Mythic (A)

**The Level Upgrade** linearly increases the effect of all the upgradable bonuses within the clothing. All the non-upgradable bonuses stay the same.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, A level 10 Legendary (C) robe gives +4% to mining efficiency, +1000 to mana, +1000 stamina, and +10 to crafting attribute, by upgrading it to level 11 it gives 4.4% to mining efficiency, +1100 to mana, and +1100 to stamina, and +10 to crafting attribute.
{% endhint %}

There is no fixed maximum level for the items as it will increase based on the level of the highest-level users.

**The Tier Upgrade** adds randomly a new effect to the clothing and the item level stays the same. When the item gets a new upgradable effect (F to E, E to D), the power of the new effect is based on the clothing level.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, A level 20 common (F) helmet gives +6% to mining efficiency, and by evolving it to Advanced (E), it will give +6% to mining efficiency and +2000 to mana. (+100 mana for each level)
{% endhint %}

Within the same higher tier (C, B, A), clothing of the same level can vary in quality. This is because the strength of the new non-upgradable effect is randomly generated within a specific range. Non-upgradable effects already in the clothing remain unchanged when the tier is upgraded.

The power range of the non-upgradable effect will get higher with each tier:

* C 50% - 100%
* B 100% - 200%
* A 200% - 300%

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, A-tier clothing could give effects to different attributes using +10 as a base, +7 to Recharge Attribute (C), +19 to Mining Attribute (B), and +25 to Crafting Attribute (A).
{% endhint %}

### Spell Book Upgrade

Each spell has six levels of power corresponding to the tiers of **Spell Books**. The power of spells increases exponentially with the tiers.

To upgrade the spell books tier, users need to merge five books of the same type and rarity for one higher-tier book.



### Essence Balance

Each character can have an unlimited amount of non-tradable **Essence**, which does not add weight to the inventory.

**Essence** can only be gained by disassembling items, and the heavier the item, the more **Essence** it will contain. A first-level character can extract <mark style="background-color:purple;">0.1</mark> **Essence** per gram, but each additional point of **Crafting** increases the amount of **Essence** per gram by <mark style="background-color:purple;">0.1</mark>.

{% hint style="info" %}
While a user with a **Crafting** of 1 will receive 100 Essence for disassembling a 1 kg item, a user with a Crafting of 20 will receive 2000 **Essence** for the same item. And a user with a Crafting of 50 will receive 5000 **Essence**.
{% endhint %}

**Essence** is needed to level up items and evolve their rarity. The amount of Essence needed to be invested in the item can be calculated by the formula: $$Essence = 5*Level^{2}*Rarity$$. This approach allows to calculate any levelling or evolution of the item by subtracting the amount of Essence already invested in the item from the requirements for the final parameters.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, a common (F) item requires 5x100x1=500 Essence to level up from level 1 to level 10. To level up this item another ten levels to level 20, it will require 5x400x1-500=1500 Essence. In order to evolve this level 20 item to uncommon rarity (E), the following amount of Essence is required: 5x400x2-2000=2000.
{% endhint %}
