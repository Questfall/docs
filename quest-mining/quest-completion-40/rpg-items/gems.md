# Gems

Level-less items of the same type and rarity are identical, so their evolution can be implemented as a simple merging. However, items with levels, such as [clothing](../items.md), are quite unique, and it is almost impossible to find two similar items.

To evolve such items, users need Gems, which are only issued as a reward for participating in the [Liquidity Program](../../../infrastructure/liquidity-providers.md), so they cannot be found in loot boxes. In that sense, Gems are special.

In all other respects, Gems are similar to all other level-less items, such as [potions](potions.md). They can be [scrapped](../rpg-attributes/crafting.md#scrapping), sold on the on the [marketplace](../../../infrastructure/marketplace.md) for [Gold](../../../assets/gold-in-game.md) (F,E,D) or [QFT](../../../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md) (C,B,A), their rarity can be [evolved](../rpg-attributes/crafting.md#evolving) through merging, and they take up [inventory](../rpg-attributes/inventory.md) space.

{% hint style="info" %}
Scrapping and evolving values in the table are calculated for a Crafting attribute of 0, where 11es means 11 Essence. Weight is calculated based on: $$Density=Rarity^{-1.1}$$.
{% endhint %}

To evolve the Gem To evolve a rarity of an item, a user needs a Gem of the same rarity tier. For example, to evolve clothing of rarity F, a Gem of rarity F is required. To evolve an item of rarity E, a Gem of rarity E is needed. And so on.

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to Gems, Essence is also [required](../rpg-attributes/crafting.md#evolving) to evolve the rarity tier.
{% endhint %}

The result is an item of the next rarity tier. This way, users only need Gold to craft C-rarity items that can be sold for QFT.&#x20;

Because rarity tier A is the highest possible tier, A-rarity Gems are not used for evolving. Instead, a user can use them to reset any of the item's fixed effects to the desired effect.
