# Quest Promotion

### Quest Duration

Each quest's duration ranges from 1 to 30 days depending on the number of days the author chose to promote their quest. Users can submit answers to the quest as long as itâ€™s active.

The length of the quest does not affect the size of the reward.

### Quest Sorting

Users can sort the quest feed to display all, followed, marked, hidden, or completed quests.

* **Followed** - The authors can be followed as creators in popular social media platforms. Users can choose to sort the feed to show quests only from those authors they are following.
* **Marked** - The users can mark those quests they see as interesting or important and create and display a feed based on them.
* **Hidden** - Undesirable quests can be hidden from the global feed by the user. Feed can be sorted to display all the hidden quests.
* **Completed** - The completed quests are automatically removed from the global feed and moved to the completed section.

### Base Reward

Each quest has a **Base Reward** of a certain number of **Mining Points**. By completing the quests users get the base reward of mining points which is then multiplied by the user's mining efficiency bonuses.

The base rewards of quests range from 10 (no promotion) up to <1000 (1000 is unreachable) depending on the author's promotion size.

In addition to the base reward, the users earn chest shards by completing quests that have been promoted.

### Mining Efficiency

By increasing the personal **Mining Efficiency** bonus a user can receive more mining points from each completed quest. The base reward of a quest is multiplied by the mining efficiency % bonus the user has.

For example, if the base reward for the quest is 50 mining points and the user has 100% of mining bonus, they receive 100 mining points from completing the quest.
{% endhint %}

Constant mining efficiency bonus can be increased by clothing, elixirs, rating quests, and adding points to the mining attribute. Spells and elixirs can give mining bonuses for a limited time or to a specific quest.
