# Quest Promotion

Authors can also add Quest Points to their quests by burning some Credits. The minimum amount is 5 Credits (equivalent to $5), which will add the amount of Quest Points to the quest as if the author had 5 Reputation or 135 Quest Points. The more Credits are burned, the higher the imaginary Reputation will be. There will be no upper limit to the number of Credits an author can burn, as the maximum Reputation 10 will be an unreachable limit.
