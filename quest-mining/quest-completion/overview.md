# Overview

At the end of each week or season, rewards for completing quests are distributed based on a user's Mining Score, which is simply the total number of Mining Points a user earns by completing quests during that period.

Each quest has a base reward set by the quest author that is the same for everyone, and users who complete the quest will receive a number of Mining Points based on that base reward and their individual Mining Power.

{% hint style="info" %}
Individual Mining Power is based on the [RPG System](../../overview/rpg-system.md).
