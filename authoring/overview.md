# Overview

The number of mining points users receive as a basic reward for a given quest is based on the quest author's reputation, which is simply a moving average of the community ratings of that author's quests.

In other words, the higher the ratings of the author's quests, the higher his reputation, and the more mining points will be used to reward his future quests.

In order to prevent malicious authors from abusing the rating system, votes are weighted differently depending on the user level. Read more in the [Ratings](ratings.md) article.

This way, authors with a higher reputation will create more rewarding quests, which will motivate users to complete them. And since the author's mining power is represented by the number of quests users complete in a week or season, an author's reward is directly affected by his reputation.

This approach makes quest quality the cornerstone of the system, as the most profitable strategy for authors is to create fun, educational or entertaining quests that are appreciated by the community, while users are motivated to complete quests created by the most diligent authors.
