{% hint style="info" %}
Marketing and partnerships are ongoing activities that we will adapt to market conditions and available resources and are therefore not described in advance.
{% endhint %}

### Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">September 2024 - October 2024</mark>

The main goal of the Initial Funding Event is to raise money for project development and initial operations by selling [Founders NFTs](tokenomics/founders-nft.md) to the public.

The main motivation to become a Founder is an endless income stream from the Questfall platform. In order to achieve this, every Sunday at least 10% of the [weekly QFT fund](tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will be distributed among the founders according to the NFT parameter called "[points](tokenomics/founders-nft.md)".

### Questfall Token (QFT)&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">November 2024</mark>

The weekly issuance of [Questfall Token (QFT)](tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will begin prior to the launch of the project to reward founders.&#x20;

Initially, 5% of all QFT issued each week will go to the Team for project development and marketing, and the remaining 95% will go to the founders, who are considered to be the initial miners. The founders' percentage will drop to the final 10% when all other rewarding activities are launched.

### Uniswap Pool

<mark style="color:yellow;">December 2024</mark>

The official Uniswap QFT-USDT swapping pool will be launched by the Team and will offer rewards to liquidity providers from very beginning.

Once the liquidity pool is operational, 8% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward liquidity providers according to their share of the pool during a week, reducing the founders' percentage to 87%.

### QFT locking

<mark style="color:yellow;">February 2025</mark>

In order to reduce the amount of QFT in circulation, the system will reward users for locking their tokens for 15 weeks.

Once locking mechanism is active, 5% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward those users who choose to lock their QFTs. The founder's percentage will be reduced accordingly to 82%.

### NFT burning

<mark style="color:yellow;">April 2025</mark>

In order to reduce the number of Miners and Founders NFTs in circulation, the system will use some of the QFT issue to buy back and burn these NFTs.

Once NFT burning is active, 2% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to buy back and burn both types of Questfall NFTs from the secondary market. The founder's percentage will be reduced accordingly to 80%.

* [ ] Smart contracts for auctions
* [ ] Personal web interface for user bids

### Questfall, version 1.0

<mark style="color:yellow;">May 2025</mark>

The launch of Questfall is the main goal at this stage. It will allow anyone to create and complete quests using the next generation crypto platform.

Once users and authors can mine, 70% of the [weekly QFT fund](roadmap.md#questfall-token-qft) will go to reward for quest activities on the platform. The founder's percentage will be reduced to the final value of 10%.
