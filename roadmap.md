# üìç Roadmap

### Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">September 2024 - October 2024</mark>

* [ ] Whitepaper (this documentation)
* [ ] Project website
* [ ] Illustrations (NFTs, whitepaper, etc...)
* [ ] Initial Funding Event: webpage and smart contracts

The main goal of the Initial Funding Event is to raise money for project development and initial operations by selling [Founders NFTs](tokenomics/founders-nft.md) to the public.

The main motivation to become a Founder is an infinite income stream from the Questfall platform. In order to achieve this, every Sunday at least 10% of the [weekly QFT fund](tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will be distributed among the founders according to the NFT parameter called "[points](tokenomics/founders-nft.md)".

### Launch of Questfall Token (QFT)&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">November 2024</mark>

The weekly issuance of [Questfall Token (QFT)](tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will begin prior to the launch of the project.&#x20;

Initially, 5% of all QFT issued each week will go to the Team for project development and marketing, and 95% will go to the founders, who are considered to be the initial miners. The founders' percentage will drop to the final 10% when other rewarding activities are launched.

### Launch of the official swapping pool

<mark style="color:yellow;">December 2024</mark>

The official Uniswap QFT-USDT swapping pool will be launched by the Team and will offer rewards to liquidity providers.

Once the liquidity pool is operational, 10% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward liquidity providers according to their share of the pool, reducing the founders' percentage to 85%.
