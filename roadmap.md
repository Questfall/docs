### Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">September 2024 - October 2024</mark>

The main goal of the Initial Funding Event is to gather money for the project development and initial functioning via selling Founders NFTs to the public. Every week 10% of Questfall Token (QFT) issuance is distributed between founders depending on the NFTs' parameter called "units".

Founders will have a part of the weekly QFT issuance forever.

### Questfall Token (QFT) launch

<mark style="color:yellow;">November 2024</mark>

The weekly issuance of Questfall Token (QFT) starts before the project launch. At the beginning 5% of all QFTs issued will go to the Team for project development and 95% will go to founders, who are considered as initial miners.
