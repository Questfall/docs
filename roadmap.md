### Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">September 2024 - October 2024</mark>

#### Preparations:

* [ ] Whitepaper (this documentation)
* [ ] Project website
* [ ] Illustrations (NFTs, whitepaper, etc...)
* [ ] Initial Funding Event: webpage and smart contracts

The main goal of the Initial Funding Event is to raise money for project development and initial operations by selling [Founders NFTs](tokenomics/founders-nft.md) to the public.

The main motivation to become a Founder is an infinite income stream from the Questfall platform. In order to achieve this, every Sunday at least 10% of the [weekly QFT fund](tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will be distributed among the founders according to the NFT parameter called "[points](tokenomics/founders-nft.md)".

### Launch of Questfall Token (QFT)&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">November 2024</mark>

The weekly issuance of [Questfall Token (QFT)](tokenomics/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will begin prior to the launch of the project.&#x20;

Initially, 5% of all QFT issued each week will go to the Team for project development and marketing, and 95% will go to the founders, who are considered to be the initial miners. The founders' percentage will drop to the final 10% when other rewarding activities are launched.

The current status: <mark style="background-color:orange;">Not yet launched...</mark>&#x20;

### Launch of the official swapping pool

<mark style="color:yellow;">December 2024</mark>

The official Uniswap QFT-USDT swapping pool will be launched by the Team and will offer rewards to liquidity providers.

Once the liquidity pool is operational, 10% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward liquidity providers according to their share of the pool, reducing the founders' percentage to 85%.

After the Staking Program is launched 5% of the QFT issuance will go to reward those users who will lock their QFTs in the treasury (depending on the amount and lock time). The founders' portion will drop accordingly to 80%.
