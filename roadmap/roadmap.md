# Roadmap

{% hint style="info" %}
Marketing and partnerships are ongoing activities that we will adapt to market conditions and available resources and are therefore not described in advance.
{% endhint %}

### Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">September 2024 - October 2024</mark>

The main goal of the Initial Funding Event is to raise money for project development and initial operations by selling [Founders NFTs](../assets/founder-nfts.md) to the public.

The main motivation to become a Founder is an endless income stream from the Questfall platform. In order to achieve this, every Sunday at least 10% of the [weekly QFT fund](../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will be distributed among the founders according to the NFT parameter called "[points](../assets/founder-nfts.md)".

### Questfall Token (QFT)&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">November 2024</mark>

The weekly issuance of [Questfall Token (QFT)](../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md) will begin prior to the launch of the project to reward founders.&#x20;

Initially, 5% of all QFT issued each week will go to the Team for project development and marketing, and the remaining 95% will go to the founders, who are considered to be the initial miners. The founders' percentage will drop to the final 10% when all other rewarding activities are launched.

### Uniswap Pool

<mark style="color:yellow;">January 2025</mark>

The official Uniswap QFT-USDT swapping pool will be launched by the Team and will offer rewards to liquidity providers from very beginning.

Once the liquidity pool is operational, 8% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward liquidity providers according to their share of the pool during a week, reducing the founders' percentage to 87%.

### QFT burning

<mark style="color:yellow;">February 2025</mark>

To ensure a minimum number of tokens are burned each week, the system will reward users for burning their tokens. Providing such rewards in advance allows founders to accumulate credits before Questfall launches, with minimal competition and therefore virtually free.

Once the burning rewards are active, 4% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to proportionally reward users who burn their QFTs. The founder's percentage will be reduced accordingly to 83%.

### QFT locking

<mark style="color:yellow;">March 2025</mark>

In order to reduce the amount of QFT in circulation, the system will reward users for locking their tokens for 15 weeks.

Once locking mechanism is active, 5% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward those users who choose to lock their QFTs. The founder's percentage will be reduced accordingly to 78%.

### NFT burning

<mark style="color:yellow;">May 2025</mark>

In order to reduce the number of Miners and Founders NFTs in circulation, the system will use some of the QFT issue to buy back and burn these NFTs.

Once NFT burning is active, 2% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to buy back and burn both types of Questfall NFTs from the secondary market. The founder's percentage will be reduced accordingly to 76%.

### Questfall, version 1.0

<mark style="color:yellow;">June 2025</mark>

The launch of Questfall is the main goal at this stage. It will allow anyone to create and complete quests using the next generation crypto platform.

Once users and authors can mine, 70% of the [weekly QFT fund](roadmap.md#questfall-token-qft) will go to reward for quest activities on the platform. The founder's percentage will be reduced to the final value of 10%.

### Local quests judged by the crowd

In addition to this, we will implement in the future versions of Questfall local quests, which will allow to find a needed worker (such as babysitter, maid, builder, gardener, pool cleaner, etc...) for your task near you.

### Functionality for third-party projects to prevent Sybil attacks

### An option to earn humanity through mini games

### Non-binary completions

Some quest completions are binary: either completed or not. But some quests assume deferent quality or quantity of completions, for example a drawing contest or a task to swap one token for another.

On Questfall this kind of nonbinary quests (contests) will be first-class citizens. When such a quest is finished the leaderboard will be formed and the users will be rewarded according to their places and the formula set by the author.

Nonbinary quests will allow to order any intellectual work such as illustrations, animations, videos, music, design, code and so on.

### Move totally on-chain
