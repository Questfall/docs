# Roadmap 2025-2026

{% hint style="info" %}
Marketing and partnerships are ongoing activities that we will adapt to market conditions and available resources and are therefore not described in advance.
{% endhint %}

### Preparing for IFE

<mark style="color:yellow;">January 2025 - March 2025</mark>

Preparing for the initial funding event by publishing landing pages and whitepaper, and through promotional activities.

### Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">March 2025 - April 2025</mark>

The main goal of the Initial Funding Event is to raise money for project development and initial operations by selling [Founder NFTs](../assets/founder-nfts.md) to the public.

The main motivation to purchase the Founder NFTs is to get a share of the initial circulating supply of QFT and an endless income stream from the Questfall platform.

### Questfall Token (QFT)&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">Right after IFE</mark>

The creation of [Questfall Token (QFT)](../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md) and its weekly issuance will start right after the Initial Funding Event. 

5% of all QFT issued each week will go to the Team for project development and marketing, and the remaining 95% will go to the holders of Founder NFTs, who are considered to be the initial miners. The founders' weekly share will drop in stages to the final 10% when all other [Rewarding Pools](../overview/quest-mining.md) are launched.

### NFT Burning

<mark style="color:yellow;">June 2025 - September 2025</mark>

In order to reduce the number of Founder NFTs in circulation, the system will use some of the QFT issue to buy back and burn these NFTs.

Once NFT burning is active, 1% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to buy back and burn Founder NFTs from the secondary market. The founder's percentage will be reduced accordingly to 94%.

* [ ] Smart contracts for auctions
* [ ] Personal web interface for user bids

### QFT Freezing

<mark style="color:yellow;">June 2025 - September 2025</mark>

In order to reduce the amount of QFT in circulation, the system will reward users for [Freezing](../infrastructure/qft-freezing.md) their tokens.

Once freezing mechanism is active, 5% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward those users who choose to freeze their QFTs. The founder's percentage will be reduced accordingly to 89%.

* [ ] Personal web interface for locking

### Liquidity Pool

<mark style="color:yellow;">2 weeks prior to platform launch</mark>

The official Uniswap QFT-USDT swapping pool will be launched by the Team and will offer rewards to [Liquidity Providers](../infrastructure/liquidity-providers.md) from the very beginning.

Once the liquidity pool is operational, 5% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward liquidity providers according to their share of the pool during a week, reducing the founders' percentage to 84%.

### Questfall, version 1.0

<mark style="color:yellow;">October 2025 - December 2025</mark>

The launch of Questfall is the main goal at this stage. It will allow anyone to create and complete quests using the next-generation crypto platform.

Once users and authors can mine, 66% of the weekly QFT issue will go to reward for quest activities on the platform and 8% for Gold withdrawals. The founder's percentage will be reduced to the final value of 10%.

* [ ] Platform server code
* [ ] Platform frontend code

## Future Plans 2026 ->

### Questfall, versions 1.5 and 2.0

### Local quests judged by the crowd

In addition to this, we will implement in the future versions of Questfall local quests, which will allow to find a needed worker (such as babysitter, maid, builder, gardener, pool cleaner, etc...) for your task near you.

### Non-binary completions

Some quest completions are binary: either completed or not. But some quests assume deferent quality or quantity of completions, for example a drawing contest or a task to swap one token for another.

On Questfall this kind of nonbinary quests (contests) will be first-class citizens. When such a quest is finished the leaderboard will be formed and the users will be rewarded according to their places and the formula set by the author.

Nonbinary quests will allow to order any intellectual work such as illustrations, animations, videos, music, design, code and so on.

### Functionality for third-party projects to prevent Sybil attacks

### Move totally on-chain
