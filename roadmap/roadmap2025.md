# Roadmap

{% hint style="info" %}
Marketing and partnerships are ongoing activities that we will adapt to market conditions and available resources, and are therefore not described in advance.
{% endhint %}

### **Designing the Project Model** <mark style="background-color:orange;">Work in progress</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">1 Year:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">March 2024 - March 2025</mark>

While we spent a year specifically developing the Questfall model, it took several years before that to crystallize the idea and overall approach, including our work on the Elysium blockchain. For example, Black-Shoulz option pricing had a huge impact on the concept of Deflationary Mining, but we decided to leave such theoretical details outside of this documentation.

As a result, we developed Questfall with a level of detail that most projects lack even after they are up and running. Although the system seems complex (and it is), implementing it in code will not be that difficult, since most of the development time is usually spent on such details that teams work out on the fly. As a result, we have spent more time planning than we will need for actual development.

### Preparing for the Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">3 Month:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">April 2025 - June 2025</mark>

There are three main tasks that need to be done before launching the Initial Funding Event. First, we need to develop the Founder NFT smart contract, taking into account the entire infrastructure of Questfall. Second, we need to gather a community of interested people who are willing to become founders of the project. And finally, we need to set up the referral program for the Influencers to attract more people to the event.

***

### Initial Funding Event (IFE)

<mark style="color:yellow;">3 Days:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">June 2025</mark>

The primary goal of the Initial Funding Event is to raise money for the initial development, operation, and marketing of Questfall by selling Founder NFTs to the public. There will be a limited number of Founder NFTs available for each of the six rarity tiers, bringing the total amount of funding we are targeting to $1.5 million.

However, there is no low cap, as we will develop Questfall regardless of the final amount we are able to raise. We will launch the project even if we raise nothing, but it will obviously take longer and be much more painful for us. This is because we see a huge potential in Defationary Quest Mining.

However, the mining approach assumes that there is no other way to get profits from the system other than receiving a portion of the token issuance. It can be considered as taking profits from a company as dividends in a conventional approach.&#x20;

These profits are only received by the founders, which can be anyone by participating in IFE. And since all founders are considered equal by the system, whatever is given to us as founders is also given to the other founders. And that is a lot to start with.

Founders will receive ongoing income from the issuance of QFTs. They will receive double the amount of money they paid for NFTs in gold equivalent during their first year of Questfal work. They will receive unique RPG items based on the rarity tier of their Founder NFTs. They will have access to the team's private group, where they can influence the project's development and receive advance notice of upcoming events.

This is why we limit the event to 3 days, because we see it as an opportunity for people to get on board, not for us to make as much money as possible. Since all unsold during the even NFTs will be burned (or more accurately, never minted), the share of actual founders will increase proportionally. So, in a sense, it is beneficial for us (as well as any other founder) to sell as few NFTs as possible.

But of course we will do our best to attract as many founders as possible, because they bring not only money, but also decentralization, experience, connections, support and fresh ideas.

### Platform Development

<mark style="color:yellow;">9 Month:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">July 2025 - March 2026</mark>

5% of all QFT issued each week will go to the Team for project development and marketing, and the remaining 95% will go to the holders of Founder NFTs, who are considered to be the initial miners. The founders' weekly share will drop in stages to the final 10% when all other [Rewarding Pools](../overview/quest-mining.md) are launched.

***

### Liquidity Generation Event (LGE)

<mark style="color:yellow;">1 Month:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">March 2026</mark>

5% of all QFT issued each week will go to the Team for project development and marketing, and the remaining 95% will go to the holders of Founder NFTs, who are considered to be the initial miners. The founders' weekly share will drop in stages to the final 10% when all other [Rewarding Pools](../overview/quest-mining.md) are launched.

***

### Questfall Launch

<mark style="color:yellow;">1 Day:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">April 2026</mark>

The launch of Questfall is the main goal at this stage. It will allow anyone to create and complete quests using the next-generation crypto platform.











### Questfall Token (QFT)

<mark style="color:yellow;">Right after IFE</mark>

The creation of [Questfall Token (QFT)](../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md) and its weekly issuance will start right after the Initial Funding Event.

5% of all QFT issued each week will go to the Team for project development and marketing, and the remaining 95% will go to the holders of Founder NFTs, who are considered to be the initial miners. The founders' weekly share will drop in stages to the final 10% when all other [Rewarding Pools](../overview/quest-mining.md) are launched.

### NFT Burning

<mark style="color:yellow;">June 2025 - September 2025</mark>

In order to reduce the number of Founder NFTs in circulation, the system will use some of the QFT issue to buy back and burn these NFTs.

Once NFT burning is active, 1% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to buy back and burn Founder NFTs from the secondary market. The founder's percentage will be reduced accordingly to 94%.

* [ ] Smart contracts for auctions
* [ ] Personal web interface for user bids

The current status: <mark style="background-color:orange;">Not yet launched...</mark>

***

### QFT Freezing

<mark style="color:yellow;">June 2025 - September 2025</mark>

In order to reduce the amount of QFT in circulation, the system will reward users for [Freezing](../infrastructure/qft-freezing.md) their tokens.

Once freezing mechanism is active, 5% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward those users who choose to freeze their QFTs. The founder's percentage will be reduced accordingly to 89%.

* [ ] Smart contract for QFT locking
* [ ] Personal web interface for locking

The current status: <mark style="background-color:orange;">Not yet launched...</mark>

### Liquidity Pool

<mark style="color:yellow;">2 weeks prior to platform launch</mark>

The official Uniswap QFT-USDT swapping pool will be launched by the Team and will offer rewards to [Liquidity Providers](../infrastructure/liquidity-providers.md) from the very beginning.

Once the liquidity pool is operational, 5% of the weekly QFT issue will be used to reward liquidity providers according to their share of the pool during a week, reducing the founders' percentage to 84%.

* [ ] Uniswap swapping pool with the initial liquidity
* [ ] Personal web interface for the liquidity providers

The current status: <mark style="background-color:orange;">Not yet launched...</mark>

***

### Questfall, version 1.0

<mark style="color:yellow;">October 2025 - December 2025</mark>

The launch of Questfall is the main goal at this stage. It will allow anyone to create and complete quests using the next-generation crypto platform.

Once users and authors can mine, 66% of the weekly QFT issue will go to reward for quest activities on the platform and 8% for Gold withdrawals. The founder's percentage will be reduced to the final value of 10%.

* [ ] Platform interface design
* [ ] Platform server code
* [ ] Platform frontend code
* [ ] Platform hardware infrastructure for running code and database

## Future Plans 2026 ->

### Questfall, versions 1.5 and 2.0

### Local quests judged by the crowd

In addition to this, we will implement in the future versions of Questfall local quests, which will allow to find a needed worker (such as babysitter, maid, builder, gardener, pool cleaner, etc...) for your task near you.

### Non-binary completions

Some quest completions are binary: either completed or not. But some quests assume deferent quality or quantity of completions, for example a drawing contest or a task to swap one token for another.

On Questfall this kind of nonbinary quests (contests) will be first-class citizens. When such a quest is finished the leaderboard will be formed and the users will be rewarded according to their places and the formula set by the author.

Nonbinary quests will allow to order any intellectual work such as illustrations, animations, videos, music, design, code and so on.

### Functionality for third-party projects to prevent Sybil attacks

### Move totally on-chain
