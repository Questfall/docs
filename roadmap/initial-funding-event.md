# Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">Planned on</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">May 2025 | 3 Days</mark>

The primary goal of the Initial Funding Event (IFE) is to raise money for the initial development, operation, and marketing of Questfall by selling 75% of the total supply of Founder NFTs to the public, while keeping 25% for the team.

{% hint style="info" %}
Founder NFTs will only be minted during the IFE and never again, as it is a one-time event.
{% endhint %}

Depending on the rarity tier, of which there are six, each Founder NFT contains a certain amount of Founder Points, which are used to distribute the founders' share of the weekly QFT issue. Since the total supply of each rarity tier is limited, the maximum amount of Founder Points is also limited and cannot exceed <mark style="background-color:purple;">2,602,200</mark>.

The number of available NFTs decreases by half with each tier, while the amount of Founder Points contained in each NFT increases by x2.243. Since each subsequent tier is double the price during the IFE, the higher tiers receive a discount on the price of each Founder Point they contain.

<table><thead><tr><th width="182">Founder NFT</th><th width="86" align="center">Points</th><th width="76" align="center">Team</th><th width="77" align="center">IFE</th><th width="86" align="center">Price</th><th width="99" align="center">Discount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">800</td><td align="center">2400</td><td align="center">$100</td><td align="center">0%</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td align="center">224</td><td align="center">400</td><td align="center">1200</td><td align="center">$200</td><td align="center">10.71%</td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td align="center">502</td><td align="center">200</td><td align="center">600</td><td align="center">$400</td><td align="center">20.32%</td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td align="center">1126</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">300</td><td align="center">$800</td><td align="center">28.95%</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td align="center">2526</td><td align="center">50</td><td align="center">150</td><td align="center">$1600</td><td align="center">36.66%</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td align="center">5666</td><td align="center">25</td><td align="center">75</td><td align="center">$3200</td><td align="center">43.52%</td></tr></tbody></table>

As a result, the total amount of money that can be raised during the IFE is limited to $1,440,000, but since there is a referral program that gives a 10% discount on the price of NFTs and 15% of the full price as a reward to Ambassadors, the final amount that a team can actually raise is limited to <mark style="background-color:purple;">$1,080,000</mark>.

However, there is no low cap, as we will develop Questfall regardless of the final amount we are able to raise. We will launch the project even if we raise nothing, as we have already put a lot of effort into it and see a great potential in Defationary Quest Mining.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Of course, it will be much easier and faster to launch Quesfall if we can hire several developers, designers and marketers.
{% endhint %}

This is why we limit the event to 3 days, because we see it as an opportunity for people to get on board, not for us to make as much money as possible.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
On the other hand, we do not limit the number of NFTs a wallet can purchase.
{% endhint %}

Since any NFTs not minted during the IFE will never be minted afterward, the shares received by existing founders will increase proportionally. So in a sense, selling as few NFTs as possible is in the best interest of every founder (including us).

But of course we will do our best to attract as many founders as possible, because they bring not only money, but also decentralization, experience, connections, support and fresh ideas.

## The Founders

Founders are people who have brought critical value to the project, without whom Questfall would not even exist. All Founders are considered equal, and we as a team will not receive any special bonuses.&#x20;

This is because the benefits of being a Founder are automatically distributed by the system to each Founder NFT owner according to their share of Founder Points. And there are a lot of benefits that come with being a Founder in Questfall.

### Passive Income for Life with Weekly QFT

The mining approach assumes that there is no other way to profit from the system other than receiving a portion of the token issuance. It can be thought of as taking profits from a company as dividends in a traditional fiat money approach.

{% hint style="info" %}
Weekly rewards can be thought of as salaries for employees and payments to vendors based on the value they add to the system during the week, while Founders are the only participants in Questfall who receive an income stream for adding one-time value. Just like shareholders in a real company.
{% endhint %}

The 10% portion of the weekly QFT issue is distributed to all Founder NFT holders according to their Founder Points, which can be thought of as mining power.&#x20;

To illustrate the financial results of becoming a Founder, let's look at the first year of Questfall.&#x20;

Since a total of 1,412,159 QFTs will be issued in the first year, the Founder's share will be 141,217 QFTs. Considering that each NFT is minted during the IFE, the following income will be received by the owners of the various Founder NFT tiers, depending on the average price of the QFT during the year.



<table><thead><tr><th width="160">Founder NFT</th><th width="119" align="center">1st Year</th><th width="112" align="center">QFT = $0.1</th><th width="97" align="center">QFT = $1</th><th width="117" align="center">QFT = $10</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td align="center">5.43 QFT</td><td align="center">$0.54</td><td align="center">$5.43</td><td align="center">$54</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td align="center">12.16 QFT</td><td align="center">$1.22</td><td align="center">$12.16</td><td align="center">$122</td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td align="center">27.24 QFT</td><td align="center">$2.72</td><td align="center">$27.24</td><td align="center">$272</td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td align="center">61.11 QFT</td><td align="center">$6.11</td><td align="center">$61.11</td><td align="center">$611</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td align="center">137.08 QFT</td><td align="center">$13.71</td><td align="center">$137.08</td><td align="center">$1,371</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td align="center">307.48 QFT</td><td align="center">$30.75</td><td align="center">$307.48</td><td align="center">$3,075</td></tr></tbody></table>

Since 500,000 QFTs will be issued during the Liquidity Generation Event to provide liquidity to the DEX swap pool, a total of 1,912,169 QFTs will be put into circulation during the first year.&#x20;

Assuming that half of these tokens will be in the liquidity pool and half in the hands, there should be approximately $10 million in the second side of the pool at the end of the first year for the price of the QFT to be $10.

However, this does not take into account the number of QFTs that will be burned during the first year, which directly affects the QFT price for the same amount of stablecoins in the pool. Therefore, since the lower the QFT price, the more tokens will be burned, we expect the QFT price to be much higher than $10 at the end of the first year.

### Double compensation for NFT costs

We want a weekly QFT reward to be a real profit that can be considered independently of the cost of the NFT itself.&#x20;

To achieve this, we include in each NFT the amount of Gold that is enough to compensate the price paid for the NFT on the IFE. Since Gold can only be withdrawn from the system with an unpredictable discount, we include 2x the NFT cost in Gold equivalent (1 Gold = $0.01).

<table><thead><tr><th width="218">Founder NFT</th><th width="151" align="center">IFE Full Price</th><th width="146" align="center">Gold Included</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td align="center">$100</td><td align="center">20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td align="center">$200</td><td align="center">40,000</td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td align="center">$400</td><td align="center">80,000</td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td align="center">$800</td><td align="center">160,000</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td align="center">$1600</td><td align="center">320,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td align="center">$3200</td><td align="center">640,000</td></tr></tbody></table>

Since the huge amounts of Gold in the system can brake a balance, the Gold compensation will be implemented by 1/12 chuncks per month. Besides the direct goal of compensation, this approach will also increase the price of Founder NFTs during the first year.

### Founders Edition Loot Boxes

Each Founder NFT will contain a certain number of Founders Edition (FE) Loot Boxes. While the regular loot boxes in the system are unrestricted and available to everyone, FE Loot Boxes are limited and only available to Founders.

FE Loot Boxes have six rarity tiers. While the Common (F) FE Loot Box doubles the chance of getting rarer items compared to the regular loot box, higher tiers will guarantee getting the RPG item of the same rarity as the loot box itself.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Uncommon (E) FE Loot Box will yield an Uncommon (E) item, Rare (D) will yield a Rare (D) item, and so on.
{% endhint %}

<table><thead><tr><th width="192">Founder NFT</th><th width="285">Founder Edition Loot Boxes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td>F x 10</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td>F x 10, E x 1</td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td>F x 10, E x 1, D x 1</td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td>F x 10, E x 1, D x 1, C x 1</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td>F x 10, E x 1, D x 1, C x 1, B x 1</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td>F x 10, E x 1, D x 1, C x 1, B x 1, A x 1</td></tr></tbody></table>

FE Loot Boxes are not included in the Founder NFTs themselves, and will be available to Founders when Questfall launches by logging into the system with the wallet address used in IFE. This means that the loot box bonus will not affect the price of the Founder NFT.

However, since there will be no higher rarity RPG items in the system at launch, owners of the rarer Founder NFTs will be the only ones with rarer items for some time. This will allow them to gain an early advantage or sell these RPG items for a profit.

### Free Leveling Up and Quest Promotion

In Questfall, there is another in-game currency besides Gold - Silver, which can be obtained through proper moderation or by burning Gold - every 1 Gold yields 10 Silver. Silver can't be exchanged back for Gold and can only be burned for leveling up or quest promotion.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since there is Gold in the Founder NFTs, it can also be used to get Silver. However, this defeats the purpose of NTS cost compensation.
{% endhint %}

<table><thead><tr><th width="218">Founder NFT</th><th width="146" align="center">Silver Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td align="center">100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td align="center">200,000</td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td align="center">400,000</td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td align="center">800,000</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td align="center">1,600,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td align="center">3,200,000</td></tr></tbody></table>

Founders will receive Silver as soon as they log in to Questfall, meaning that the Silver bonus is not tied to the NFT itself, but rather to the wallet address used by the Founder during the IFE.&#x20;

And while Silver is non-tradable and non-withdrawable, it will be fully released immediately after the first sign-in, giving Founders an early boost in the system.

### Long-term NFT Price Increase

The 1% portion of the weekly QFT issuance is used by the system to buy back and burn Founder NFTs through the auction mechanism based on Founder Point price bids.&#x20;

This means that the amount of Founder NFTs in circulation will decrease over time, increasing the weekly QFT reward for each remaining Founder. This also means that the price of Founder NFTs will increase over time.

Furthermore, at some point in the future, only one Founder will remain, and that Founder will be able to sell the last NFT at any price he or she is willing to wait for, as the unused QFTs in the auction accumulate each week.

### Private Founders Club

The founders of the higher tiers (C, B, A) will have access to the team's private group, where they will be able to influence the development of the project and receive advance notice of upcoming events.

While this bonus may not seem very valuable to investors who only care about money, the Founders Club will be priceless to those who see the bigger picture and the potential impact that the ideas and approaches implemented in Questfall will have on the entire crypto space and society.

## The Ambassadors

The IFE referral program allows influencers, community managers, and even regular users to make quick money by attracting potential founders to the event.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to become an ambassador, you will need to create a ticket in the [Questfall Discord Community](https://discord.com/invite/9BDjb3GrHA).
{% endhint %}

On the one hand, users who want to become a Founder will receive a 10% discount on the Founder NFT price if they use an Ambassador's referral code.

Ambassadors, on the other hand, will receive 15% of the full NFT price immediately as the user's transaction will be split into two payments: one for the team and one for the Ambassador.

<table><thead><tr><th width="182">Founder NFT</th><th width="86" align="center">Price</th><th width="148" align="center">User Payment</th><th width="132" align="center">Ambassador</th><th width="138" align="center">Team</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td align="center">$100</td><td align="center">$90</td><td align="center">$15</td><td align="center">$75</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td align="center">$200</td><td align="center">$180</td><td align="center">$30</td><td align="center">$150</td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td align="center">$400</td><td align="center">$360</td><td align="center">$60</td><td align="center">$300</td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td align="center">$800</td><td align="center">$720</td><td align="center">$120</td><td align="center">$600</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td align="center">$1600</td><td align="center">$1440</td><td align="center">$240</td><td align="center">$1200</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td align="center">$3200</td><td align="center">$2880</td><td align="center">$480</td><td align="center">$2400</td></tr></tbody></table>

A total of $216,000 will be distributed to the Ambassadors, who will also have the opportunity to increase their reputation in their communities, as projects like Questfall do not come along very often.
