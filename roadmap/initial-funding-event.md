# Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">Planned on</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">May 2025 | 3 Days</mark>

The primary goal of the Initial Funding Event (IFE) is to raise money for the initial development, operation, and marketing of Questfall by selling 75% of the total supply of Founder NFTs to the public, while keeping 25% for the team.

{% hint style="info" %}
Founder NFTs will only be minted during the IFE and never again, as it is a one-time event.
{% endhint %}

Depending on the rarity tier, of which there are six, each Founder NFT contains a certain amount of Founder Points, which are used to distribute the founders' share of the weekly QFT issue. Since the total supply of each rarity tier is limited, the maximum amount of Founder Points is also limited and cannot exceed <mark style="background-color:purple;">2,602,200</mark>.

The number of available NFTs decreases by half with each tier, while the amount of Founder Points contained in each NFT increases by x2.243. Since each subsequent tier is double the price during the IFE, the higher tiers receive a discount on the price of each Founder Point they contain.

<table><thead><tr><th width="164">NFT Rarity Tier</th><th width="86" align="center">Points</th><th width="76" align="center">Team</th><th width="77" align="center">IFE</th><th width="86" align="center">Price</th><th width="99" align="center">Discount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">800</td><td align="center">2400</td><td align="center">$100</td><td align="center">0%</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td align="center">224</td><td align="center">400</td><td align="center">1200</td><td align="center">$200</td><td align="center">10.71%</td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td align="center">502</td><td align="center">200</td><td align="center">600</td><td align="center">$400</td><td align="center">20.32%</td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td align="center">1126</td><td align="center">100</td><td align="center">300</td><td align="center">$800</td><td align="center">28.95%</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td align="center">2526</td><td align="center">50</td><td align="center">150</td><td align="center">$1600</td><td align="center">36.66%</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td align="center">5666</td><td align="center">25</td><td align="center">75</td><td align="center">$3200</td><td align="center">43.52%</td></tr></tbody></table>

As a result, the total amount of money that can be raised during the IFE is limited to $1,440,000, but since there is a referral program that gives a 10% discount on the price of NFTs and 15% of the full price as a reward to Ambassadors, the final amount that a team can actually raise is limited to <mark style="background-color:purple;">$1,080,000</mark>.

However, there is no low cap, as we will develop Questfall regardless of the final amount we are able to raise. We will launch the project even if we raise nothing, as we have already put a lot of effort into it and see a great potential in Defationary Quest Mining.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
However, it will be much easier and faster to launch Quesfall if we can hire several developers, designers and marketers.
{% endhint %}

This is why we limit the event to 3 days, because we see it as an opportunity for people to get on board, not for us to make as much money as possible. Since any NFTs not minted during the IFE will never be minted afterward, the shares received by existing founders will increase proportionally. So in a sense, selling as few NFTs as possible is in the best interest of every founder (including us).

But of course we will do our best to attract as many founders as possible, because they bring not only money, but also decentralization, experience, connections, support and fresh ideas.

## The Founders

All Founders are considered equal, as people who have brought crucial value to the project, without whom Questfall would not even exist.&#x20;

We as a team will not receive any special bonuses as the benefits of being a Founder are automatically distributed by the system to each Founder NFT owner according to their share of Founder Points. And there are a lot of benefits that come with being a Founder in Questfall.

### Passive Income for Life with Weekly QFT

The mining approach assumes that there is no other way to profit from the system other than receiving a portion of the token issuance. It can be thought of as taking profits from a company as dividends in a traditional fiat money approach.

{% hint style="info" %}
Weekly rewards can be thought of as salaries for employees and payments to vendors based on the value they add to the system during the week, while Founders are the only participants in Questfall who receive an income stream for adding one-time value. Just like shareholders in a real company.
{% endhint %}

The 10% portion of the weekly QFT issue is distributed to all Founder NFT holders according to their Founder Points, which can be thought of as mining power.&#x20;

To illustrate the financial results of becoming a Founder, let's look at the first year of Questfall. Since a total of 1,412,159 QFTs will be issued in the first year, the Founder's share will be 141,217 QFTs. Considering that each NFT is minted during the IFE, the following income will be received by the owners of the various Founder NFT tiers, depending on the average price of the QFT during the year.



<table><thead><tr><th width="160">NFT Rarity Tier</th><th width="119" align="center">1st Year</th><th width="112" align="center">QFT = $0.1</th><th width="97" align="center">QFT = $1</th><th width="104" align="center">QFT = $5</th><th width="117" align="center">QFT = $10</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td align="center">5.43 QFT</td><td align="center">$0.54</td><td align="center">$5.43</td><td align="center">$27</td><td align="center">$54</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td align="center">12.16 QFT</td><td align="center">$1.22</td><td align="center">$12.16</td><td align="center">$61</td><td align="center">$122</td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td align="center">27.24 QFT</td><td align="center">$2.72</td><td align="center">$27.24</td><td align="center">$136</td><td align="center">$272</td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td align="center">61.11 QFT</td><td align="center">$6.11</td><td align="center">$61.11</td><td align="center">$306</td><td align="center">$611</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td align="center">137.08 QFT</td><td align="center">$13.71</td><td align="center">$137.08</td><td align="center">$685</td><td align="center">$1,371</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td align="center">307.48 QFT</td><td align="center">$30.75</td><td align="center">$307.48</td><td align="center">$1,537</td><td align="center">$3,075</td></tr></tbody></table>

Since 500,000 QFTs will be issued during the Liquidity Generation Event to provide liquidity to the DEX swap pool, a total of 1,912,169 QFTs will be put into circulation during the first year. Assuming that only half of the tokens will be in the liquidity pool, there should be approximately $10 million in the second side of the pool for the price of the QFT to be $10.

However, this does not take into account the number of QFTs that will be burned during the first year, which directly affects the QFT price for the same amount of stablecoins in the pool. Therefore, since the lower the QFT price, the more tokens will be burned, we expect the QFT price to be much higher than $10 at the end of the first year.

### Double compensation for NFT costs

We want a weekly QFT reward to be a real profit that can be considered independently of the cost of the NFT itself. To achieve this, we include in each NFT the amount of Gold that is enough to compensate the price paid for the NFT on the IFE. Since Gold can only be withdrawn from the system with an unpredictable discount, we include 2x the NFT cost in Gold equivalent (1 Gold = $0.01).

<table><thead><tr><th width="218">NFT Rarity Tier</th><th width="151" align="center">IFE Full Price</th><th width="146" align="center">Gold Included</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td align="center">$100</td><td align="center">20,000</td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td align="center">$200</td><td align="center">40,000</td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td align="center">$400</td><td align="center">80,000</td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td align="center">$800</td><td align="center">160,000</td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td align="center">$1600</td><td align="center">320,000</td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td align="center">$3200</td><td align="center">640,000</td></tr></tbody></table>

Since the huge amounts of Gold in the system can brake a balance, the Gold compensation will be implemented by 1/12 chuncks per month. Besides the direct goal of compensation, this approach will also increase the price of Founder NFTs during the first year.

### Founders Edition Loot Boxes

Each Founder NFT will contain a certain number of Founders Edition (FE) Loot Boxes. While the regular loot boxes in the system are unrestricted and available to everyone, FE Loot Boxes are limited and only available to Founders.

{% hint style="info" %}
FE Loot Boxes are not included in the Founder NFTs themselves, and will be available to Founders when Questfall launches by logging into the system with the wallet address used in IFE.
{% endhint %}

FE Loot Boxes have six rarity tiers. While the Common (F) FE Loot Box doubles the chance of getting rarer items compared to the regular loot box, higher tiers will guarantee getting the RPG item of the same rarity as the loot box itself.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Uncommon (E) FE Loot Box will yield an Uncommon (E) item, Rare (D) will yield a Rare (D) item, and so on.
{% endhint %}

<table><thead><tr><th width="192">Founder NFTs</th><th width="71" align="center">F</th><th width="70" align="center">E</th><th width="67">D</th><th width="65">C</th><th width="64">B</th><th width="68">A</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Common (F)</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center"></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Uncommon (E)</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Rare (D)</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Epic (C)</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Legendary (B)</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Mythical (A)</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody></table>

Since there will be no higher rarity RPG items in the system at launch, owners of the rarer Founder NFTs will be the only ones with rarer items for some time. This will allow them to gain an advantage from the start or sell these RPG items for profit.

### Free Leveling Up and Quest Promotion



### Long-term NFT Price Increase

And of course the Founder NFTs will be burned by the system, making them a deflationary asset.

### Private Founders Club

They will have access to the team's private group, where they can influence the project's development and receive advance notice of upcoming events.
