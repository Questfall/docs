# Initial Funding Event

<mark style="color:yellow;">Planned:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">June 2025</mark>&#x20;

<mark style="color:yellow;">Duration:</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">3 Days</mark>

The primary goal of the Initial Funding Event is to raise money for the initial development, operation, and marketing of Questfall by selling Founder NFTs to the public. There will be a limited number of Founder NFTs available for each of the six rarity tiers, bringing the total amount of funding we are targeting to $1.5 million.

However, there is no low cap, as we will develop Questfall regardless of the final amount we are able to raise. We will launch the project even if we raise nothing, as we have already put a lot of effort into it and see a great potential in Defationary Quest Mining.&#x20;

But of course it will be much easier and faster to launch Quesfall if we can hire several developers, designers and marketers.

The mining approach assumes that there is no other way to get profits from the system other than receiving a portion of the token issuance. It can be considered as taking profits from a company as dividends in a conventional approach.&#x20;

These profits are only received by the founders, which can be anyone by participating in IFE. And since all founders are considered equal by the system, whatever is given to us as founders is also given to the other founders. And that is a lot to start with.

Founders will receive ongoing income from the issuance of QFTs. They will receive double the amount of money they paid for NFTs in gold equivalent during their first year of Questfal work. They will receive unique RPG items based on the rarity tier of their Founder NFTs. They will have access to the team's private group, where they can influence the project's development and receive advance notice of upcoming events.

And of course the Founder NFTs will be burned by the system, making them a deflationary asset.

This is why we limit the event to 3 days, because we see it as an opportunity for people to get on board, not for us to make as much money as possible. Since any NFTs not minted during the IFE will never be minted afterward, the shares received by existing founders will increase proportionally. So, in a sense, it is beneficial for us (as well as any other founder) to sell as few NFTs as possible.

But of course we will do our best to attract as many founders as possible, because they bring not only money, but also decentralization, experience, connections, support and fresh ideas.
