# Questfall Model Description

<mark style="color:orange;">March 2025</mark>

While we spent more than a year specifically developing the Questfall model, it took several years before that to crystallize the idea and overall approach, including our work on the Elysium blockchain. For example, Black-Shoulz option pricing had a huge impact on the concept of Deflationary Mining, but we decided to leave such theoretical details outside of this documentation.

As a result, we developed Questfall with a level of detail that most projects lack even after they are up and running. Although the system seems complex (and it is), implementing it in code will not be that difficult, since most of the development time is usually spent on such details that teams work out on the fly. As a result, we have spent more time planning than we will need for actual development.
