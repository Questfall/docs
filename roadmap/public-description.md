While we spent more than a year specifically developing the Questfall model, it took several years before that to crystallize the idea and overall approach, including our work on the Elysium blockchain. For example, Black-Shoulz option pricing had a huge impact on the concept of Deflationary Mining, but we decided to leave such theoretical details outside of this documentation.

As a result, we designed the Questfall model with a level of detail that most projects lack, even after they are up and running.

Before development even starts, we already have everything we need (even if it is not yet published): from prototypes of all the pages in the system to the RPG items' visual design and the special power of the effects they can have.

Every innovation we mention has a solid background. For example, in order to implement QFT freezing, we had to implement a proprietary mathematical model on top of the common approach of distributing rewards based on the share in the vault, which is used in most smart contracts to avoid looping in the code.

Although the system seems complex (and it is), implementing it in code will not be that difficult. Most development time is usually spent working out such details on the fly, while spending a lot of time on planning drastically reduces the time needed for actual development.
