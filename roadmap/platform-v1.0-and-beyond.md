# Questfall v1.0

<mark style="color:yellow;">Scheduled for release in</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">December 2026</mark>

The launch of Questfall is nothing special, except that we have to do a lot of pre-partnerships in order to have as many quests as possible on the platform beforehand.

However, launching QFT is another story.&#x20;

We have considered every possible way to launch QFT with deep liquidity from the start, as this is a common approach now applied to pre-mined tokens. But with mining it seems impossible - in any approach there are holes for manipulation or taking advantage of being first.

And since we are stubborn in our desire to make a fair system, we decided to launch QFT without liquidity, making everyone equal.

{% hint style="info" %}
In fact, the mining approach implies that there is no upfront liquidity, since there are no tokens before the first rewards are distributed. For example, Bitcoin was not tradable for some time.
{% endhint %}

There are two activities that require the use of QFTs - Liquidity Program and QFT Freezing, each with a reward of 5% of the issue. During the first week, there will be no QFTs in circulation, so these activities will not be available. Rewards for them will go to the Team at the end of the first week.

Therefore, the Team will receive a total of 15% or 4728.45 QFT on the first issue.

Another problem is that since there are no QFTs in existence, users will not be able to get Gold by burning QFTs. So during the first week, users will be able to buy Gold directly with stablecoins at a discount.

{% hint style="info" %}
The initial discount will be 70%, and this discount will decrease by 10% each day, so that by the end of the week there will be no discount on Gold.
{% endhint %}

In this way, the Team will receive an additional fund of stablecoins received for Gold, the size of which is difficult to estimate in advance.

At the end of the first week after the QFT rewards are distributed, the Team will create a DEX pool with all QFTs received at a price of $1 per QFT: 4728.45 QFT / $4728.45.

{% hint style="info" %}
Rewards for the Liquidity Program and QFT Freezing will be distributed on a regular basis - 5% of the weekly QFT issue each - starting from the second week.
{% endhint %}

Any funds remaining after the Gold pre-sale will be used later by the Team to add liquidity to the QFT reward pool, as we do not need much additional funding for development during the first year of the platform launch, while the ability to trade QFTs is very important to the overall health of the system.

As a result, there will be DEX swapping pool starting from week two and the liquidity will grow organically due to the Liquidity Program, and there will be no way for anyone to manipulate or benefit from the liquidity funds on QFT launch.
