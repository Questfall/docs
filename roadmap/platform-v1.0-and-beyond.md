# Questfall v1.0

<mark style="color:yellow;">Scheduled for release in</mark> <mark style="color:orange;">December 2025</mark>

Developing a platform like Questfall is technically nothing special - we have done many similar services. To get an overall picture, the following things need to be done to get the platform up and running:

* design of the pages;
* design of the RPG items;
* sandbox for testing the system balance;
* web server code;
* interface code;
* smart contracts.&#x20;

The most difficult tasks are getting all the pieces to work together smoothly and protecting the system from hackers and other types of threats, such as DDoS attacks. But as mentioned in the [Detailed Project Description](project-overview.md) article, we had all the critical details worked out before IFE and even had working code for many aspects of the system.

The launch of Questfall is nothing special, except that we have to do a lot of pre-partnerships in order to have as many quests as possible on the platform beforehand.

However, launching QFT is another story.&#x20;

We have considered every possible way to launch QFT with deep liquidity from the start, as this is a common approach now applied to pre-mined tokens. But with mining it seems impossible - in any approach there are holes for manipulation or taking advantage of being first.

And since we are stubborn in our desire to make a fair system, we decided to launch QFT without liquidity, making everyone equal.

{% hint style="info" %}
In fact, the mining approach implies that there is no upfront liquidity, since there are no tokens before the first rewards are distributed. For example, Bitcoin was not tradable for some time.
{% endhint %}

There are two activities that require the use of QFTs - Liquidity Program and QFT Freezing, each with a reward of 5% of the issue. During the first week, there will be no QFTs in circulation, so these activities will not be available. Rewards for them will go to the Team at the end of the first week.

{% hint style="info" %}
Rewards for the Liquidity Program and the QFT Freezing will begin to be distributed on a regular basis, each at 5% of the weekly QFT issue, starting in the second week.
{% endhint %}

Therefore, the Team will receive a total of 15% or 4728.45 QFT on the first issue.

Another problem is that since there are no QFTs in existence during the first week, users will not be able to get Gold by burning QFTs. To solve this problem, the Team will hold a Gold pre-sale where users will be able to buy Gold directly from the Team at a discount using stablecoins.

{% hint style="info" %}
The initial discount will be 42% and will decrease by 6% daily until it reaches 0. After the first week, Gold can only be obtained by burning QFT.
{% endhint %}

In this way, the Team will receive an additional fund of stablecoins, the size of which is difficult to estimate in advance. At the end of the first week after the QFT rewards are distributed, the Team will create a DEX pool with all QFTs received at a price of $1 per QFT: 4728.45 QFT / $4728.45.

{% hint style="info" %}
To deepen the liquidity, the Team will offer all founders and miners to buy their QFT OTC for $1. All QFT bought this way will be added to the liquidity pool.
{% endhint %}

Any funds received during the Gold pre-sale and remaining after the creation of the initial DEX pool will also be used later by the Team to increase liquidity, as we do not need much additional funding for development during the first year of the platform launch, while the ability to trade QFTs is very important for the overall health of the system.

As a result, there will be a DEX swapping pool starting week two, and liquidity will grow organically due to the Liquidity Program, and there will be no way for anyone to manipulate or profit from the liquidity funds at QFT launch, even the Team.
