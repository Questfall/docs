# Future Plans

## Future Plans 2026 ->

### Questfall, versions 1.5 and 2.0

### Local quests judged by the crowd

In addition to this, we will implement in the future versions of Questfall local quests, which will allow to find a needed worker (such as babysitter, maid, builder, gardener, pool cleaner, etc...) for your task near you.

### Non-binary completions

Some quest completions are binary: either completed or not. But some quests assume deferent quality or quantity of completions, for example a drawing contest or a task to swap one token for another.

On Questfall this kind of nonbinary quests (contests) will be first-class citizens. When such a quest is finished the leaderboard will be formed and the users will be rewarded according to their places and the formula set by the author.

Nonbinary quests will allow to order any intellectual work such as illustrations, animations, videos, music, design, code and so on.

### Functionality for third-party projects to prevent Sybil attacks

### Move totally on-chain
