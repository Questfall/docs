## Non-binary completions

Some quest completions are binary: either completed or not. But some quests assume deferent quality or quantity of completions, for example a drawing contest or a task to swap one token for another.

On Questfall this kind of nonbinary quests (contests) will be first-class citizens. When such a quest is finished the leaderboard will be formed and the users will be rewarded according to their places and the formula set by the author.
