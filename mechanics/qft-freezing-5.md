# QFT freezing (5%)

Ensuring that tokens are not sold by the user for a certain period of time benefits the system. To encourage such behavior, 5% of the newly created QFTs will be used each week to reward those users who freeze their tokens in the system for 15 weeks. The rewards for token freezing will begin before the launch of Questfall and will continue indefinitely, reducing the amount of QFT in circulation at any given time by frozen tokens.

At the initial freeze, the QFT holder locks the tokens in the system for 15 weeks, and obviously the freeze period decreases by one every week. At the same time, a fixed number of QFTs, used as a reward for freezing, are distributed according to the individual freezing power of each user. This freezing power is calculated as the product of the frozen tokens and the number of weeks remaining in the freeze period.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, if the user has frozen 100 QFTs, his freezing power will be 1500 at the end of the first week and 1400 at the end of the second week. In other words, the multiplier used to calculate freezing power decreases by one each week: 15, 14, 13, .... 1, 0. This can be seen as the frozen tokens slowly melt, reducing the reward.
{% endhint %}

To receive the maximum freezing power, a user can re-freeze tokens at any time for a maximum of 15 weeks. This means that in order to receive the maximum freezing reward in perpetuity, the user must re-freeze his tokens on a weekly basis.

{% hint style="info" %}
We use the word _**freezing**_ because _**staking**_ implies the possibility of losing the money staked, and _**locking**_ implies the fixed reward for a fixed lock period. Freezing guarantees that the number of tokens owned by the user cannot be reduced, while the mechanism is based on user competition, making it much more flexible and attractive than a simple time lock.
