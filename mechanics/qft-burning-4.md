# ðŸ”¥ QFT burning (4%)

QFT tokens can be burned for [Credits](../assets/gold-in-game.md), which in turn can be used by users to replenish their Humanity or by authors to promote their quests. In order to increase the number of tokens burned, 4% of the newly created QFTs will be used each week to reward users who burn their QFTs for Credits during that week.

This approach creates an arbitrage by ensuring that if less than 4% of the weekly token creation is burned during a week, there is an opportunity to burn QFTs and return more than that as a reward. In effect, 4% of the weekly token creation becomes a floor that guarantees a minimum amount of QFT burned per week.&#x20;

Meanwhile, for Credits, users receive value (quest promotion or Humanity) from the system, which implies burning more than 4% of the weekly token creation.
