# ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• NFT burning (2%)

Our goal is to maximise the price of NFTs over the long term. In order to achieve this, 2% of the newly created QFTs are allocated each week to the purchase of [Mining ](../assets/miners-nft.md)(1%) and [Founder](../assets/founders-nft.md) (1%) NFTs from the market via auction, with the subsequent burning of these NFTs.

The buyback and burning of NFTs will begin shortly before the launch of Questfall and will continue until there are no NFTs left in circulation. This will not only ensure that the price of NFTs rises in the long term but will also increase the share of the weekly reward for each Founder who does not burn their [points](../assets/founders-nft.md).

### How the auction works

There will be two independent auctions each week, one for Miners NFTs and one for Founders NFTs. In these two auctions, the system will use 2% of the weekly QFT fund (1% for each type of NFT) to buy back NFTs offered by users. User bids will be ranked according to the price of the NFT parameter - one cent for Miners NFTs or one point for Founders NFTs.

Bought NFTs will be burned and the remaining QFTs allocated for buyback will be carried over to the next week. This means that if user bids are too high this week and the system is unable to buy even one NFT, the amount allocated for buyback will be increased at the next auction. After several such accumulations, the system is guaranteed to meet user bids.

Due to the limitations of smart contracts, the maximum number of offers that can be filled each week is 50.
{% endhint %}

The last owners of each type of NFT will have the most to gain. In fact, they will be able to get as many QFTs for them as they are willing to wait for, as the amount the system will offer for burning NFTs will increase each week.
