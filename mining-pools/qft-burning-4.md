# ðŸ”¥ QFT burning (4%)

QFT tokens can be burned for [Credits](../assets/credits-off-chain.md), which in turn can be used by users to replenish their Humanity or by authors to promote their quests. In order to increase the number of tokens burned, 4% of the [weekly QFT creation ](../trash-bin/overview.md)will be used to reward users who burn their QFTs for Credits during that week.

This approach creates an arbitrage by ensuring that if less than 4% of the weekly QFT creation is burned in a week, there is an opportunity to burn QFTs and return more than that as a reward. In effect, 4% of the weekly creation becomes a floor that guarantees a minimum amount of QFT burned per week.&#x20;

Meanwhile, for credits, users receive value (quest promotion or Humanity) from the system, which implies burning more than 4% of the weekly creation.
