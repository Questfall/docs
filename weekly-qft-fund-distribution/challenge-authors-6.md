  users who create challenges.

# ðŸš§ Challenge authors (6%)

For a solid defense against Sibil attacks, the number of challenges in the system should be sufficient in relation to the total number of users. Also, users should be motivated to create interesting and high-quality challenges.

To achieve this, any user can create a challenge, which becomes active once it has been approved by the crowd. The system will distribute 2% of the weekly QFT fund to reward authors whose challenges are accepted during the week.&#x20;

To maintain quality, an additional 4% of the weekly QFT fund will be distributed to authors who created challenges in previous weeks, based on the ranking of their challenges.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
As the user vote is not applied to the challenge rating until the user's completion of the challenge has been approved by the crowd, bots and multi-accounts will not be able to abuse the challenge rating.
{% endhint %}

To keep the system self-cleaning, 10% of the lowest rated challenges will be removed each week. This means that authors who create high quality challenges will continue to earn passive income for an unlimited period of time, while low quality challenges will be removed, and their authors will no longer receive weekly rewards.
