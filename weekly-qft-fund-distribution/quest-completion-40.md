About Creators\
To achieve high-quality quests a % of the QFT distribution is directed to creators.\
Each creator account will have a rating based on which QFT will be distributed. Other variables will be taken into consideration, before distribution, like the number of weekly created quests and the average of weekly rating \
\
Every quest will be rated by Validators from 1 to 10 stars. To receive QFT, the creator must be in top 50% most rated. \






1. Mining QFT by completing quests\
   Users can earn QFT by completing quests and gaining XP. At every checkpoint, QFT is distributed based on the amount of XP earned, with a bigger share going to those with more XP.
2. Leveling up by completing quests\
   The base XP earned from each quest is added to levels. As users level up, they will receive more rewards.\
