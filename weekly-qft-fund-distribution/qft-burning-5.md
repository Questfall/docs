# ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• QFT burning (4%)

QFT tokens can be burned for [Credits](../tokenomics/credits-off-chain.md), which in turn can be used by users to replenish their [Stamina bar](mining-65/users-40/humanity-points.md) or by authors to promote their quests. In order to increase the number of tokens burned, 4% of the [weekly QFT fund](overview.md) will be used to reward users who burn their QFTs for Credits during that week.

This approach creates an arbitrage by ensuring that if less than 4% of the weekly QFT fund is burned in a week, there is an opportunity to burn QFTs and return more than that as a reward. In effect, 4% of the weekly fund becomes a floor that guarantees a minimum amount of QFT burned per week.&#x20;

Meanwhile, for credits, users receive value (quest promotion or stamina) from the system, which implies burning more than 4% of the weekly fund.
