# RPG System

While deflation solves a lot of problems and is indeed the best economic approach (as shown in the article [Deflationary Tokenomics](deflationary-tokenomics.md)), it is still not a silver bullet because it creates new challenges to overcome as deflation's main advantage becomes its main weakness.

On the one hand, deflation makes any asset a good investment because of its potential price increase, but on the other hand, if that increase is realised, it pushes up the real cost of using the system when payments are denominated in the currency that gets stronger over time.

{% hint style="info" %}
This can be clearly seen in the examples of BTC or ETH - as the price of blockchain cryptocurrencies rises, the fees denominated in them become very expensive in dollars.
{% endhint %}

This problem can be easily solved by introducing another token for payments. In this case, two different money functions, which for some reason are usually combined in one currency (a store of value and a medium of exchange), are allocated to different assets.

While a store of value must be deflationary to fulfil its function, the medium of exchange should not be too volatile so that prices do not fluctuate too much relative to other goods and services in the economy.

In Questfall, deflationary QFT is the main store of value, while Gold (a dollar-based in-game currency) is used to pay into the system for mining bonuses or quest promotions. As a result, system prices are set in dollars and are independent of the price of QFT.

However, this introduces another problem: since QFT tokens are burned when Gold is deposited, there is nothing left on the chain to be returned in exchange for Gold when a user wants to withdraw it. In other words, there's no liquidity pool to back up user withdrawals, so the Gold can't be withdrawn.

{% hint style="info" %}
Stablecoin liquidity pools, which are typically used to support withdrawals, create demand and add value to the stablecoins themselves, not the system. Such pools are also a prime target for hackers, who can drain the liquidity completely, making in-game assets worthless.
{% endhint %}

This is where the RPG system comes in. Not only does it help solve the problem of extracting value from the system without liquidity pools, but it also fits like a glove into the user levels used to protect the system from Sybil attacks.&#x20;

Furthermore, the RPG approach itself increases user engagement by allowing many possible strategies in addition to the basic one of completing as many quests as possible.

In this article, we will look at the big picture, rather than going into deep details that may change as Questfall is developed.
