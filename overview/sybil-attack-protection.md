# Sybil attack protection

In Bitcoin, obtaining the hash needed to link the newly created block to the existing chain requires many calculations that cannot be faked - otherwise such a hack could be used to create much more efficient computers. This makes mining with the Proof of Work consensus fair.

{% hint style="info" %}
Fair mining means that the rules by which users add value to the system and are rewarded can't be abused by some kind of workaround.
{% endhint %}

However, such fair mining is difficult to achieve without Proof of Work. For example, if the system rewards users for completing quests, fake completions can easily be generated by code from many accounts (a form of Sybil attack), and the system will not be able to distinguish such fakes from real user completions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Perhaps in the future AI will evolve to the point where it can become an infallible judge, but for now it is more robust to use the algorithm that blindly uses a set of rules and the numbers given as input to distribute the reward among the miners.
{% endhint %}

The problem is that if it's possible to sell a generated fake into the system, the real value, which takes effort to create, can't compete with the fakes, which are created by thousands in a second. In the end, only fakes will be added to the system, because the reward for each unit of value will be so small that it will not make sense to put effort into creating a real value.

One of the most common solutions that has been tried in recent years to prevent fraud in the absence of Proof of Work is to use the limits of human nature itself. From various KYC systems with confirmation in the form of NFT, to all sorts of pedometers and tappers on mobile devices.

However, none of these approaches have been successful because developers are trying to solve the same problem as Proof of Work - rewarding only those miners who create real value. But unless the system can easily distinguish between real and fake value, and users consume a finite resource while mining, this problem is unsolvable.

A phone or NFT allows a user to automate the necessary actions or scale the mining power across many accounts, as each is a one-time cost. Furthermore, KYC accounts are sold in bundles for pennies, while building a farm of thousands of phones is not difficult or expensive these days.

So at the moment there is no real approach to fair mining other than Proof of Work, and today's teams prefer to take the easy way out and mint all the tokens for themselves at once and then sell them to the crowd.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is actually nothing new. At the dawn of the stock market more than 150 years ago, anyone could issue their own securities and sell them to the public through newspaper advertisements.
{% endhint %}

However, this does not mean that fair mining is impossible outside the Proof of Work consensus - we just need to look at the problem from a different angle. And all we have to do is change the goal slightly. From 'do not reward cheaters' to 'do not reward cheaters at the expense of good miners'.

In Questfall, we achieve this new goal through two key concepts: **Community Moderation** and **User Levels**.

Community Moderation is used to solve the problem of distinguishing between fake and real quest completions. It is essentially a user vote, the results of which are used as input into the system that rewards miners for completing quests.

As well as helping the system to distribute rewards fairly, community moderation has another very important aspect - although validating quest completion can easily be done by hand for free, automating it with code requires ongoing costs.

For example, many types of completion (for example, if the quest is to draw something) can only be validated using AI, and that's quite expensive. But even if Questfall had its own LLM running on free servers, it wouldn't solve the problem, because such an AI would have to access the content on other platforms. And those platforms ban bots to prevent DDoS attacks. For example, there is only one official way to access tweets with the code - [a paid API](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api).

{% hint style="info" %}
While users can't validate completions with code for free (otherwise the system could do it itself), they can try to manipulate the moderation process to pass off the fake completion as real. This is why the voting rules are not so simple - read more about this in the [Community Moderation](../quest-mining/community-moderation.md) article.
{% endhint %}

As a result Community Moderation can be used for building a user hierarchy, progression through which can't be automated by bots for free. To take advantage of this, users who participate in moderation and properly validate completions earn XP, which is used to increase User Level.

This way, progressing through levels requiers efforts or money and as a result users form a pyramid, as the higher the level, the fewer users will have it. The key is that the rewards for different user levels are fixed and do not depend on the activity on other levels. So raising a level allows a user to mine more with the same mining power as the competition lowers with each level.&#x20;

The percentage of bots will also decrease with each level, as gaining XP cannot be automated without ongoing costs.







As a result, if a good miner is earning too little for his efforts, all he has to do is level up by adding value to the system in the form of moderation or QFT burning.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The percentage of bots will decrease with each level, as XP gain cannot be automated without ongoing costs, and as a result it is more profitable to invest money in one account to level it up, than spread it to many.
{% endhint %}



This approach assumes that there are no restrictions on the mining process, only different levels of competition depending on the performance of each user. This means that multiple accounts and bots can be used to scale mining power during quest mining.

But the leveling system protects good users from being influenced by bad ones, because users form a pyramid with their levels. The higher the level, the fewer users will have it. So it is possible that there will be a lot of bots on the first level, but the higher the level of the user, the fewer competitors there will be on the same level of the pyramid, including bots.

Crucially, the rewards for different levels are fixed and do not depend on the number of users at other levels. So tenth level users will only be competing with each other for a fixed reward that does not depend on the number or mining power of first level users (or bots).

{% hint style="info" %}
This approach can be compared to the independent sections of a submarine. Read the article about [User rewards](../quest-mining/user-rewards.md) for more details.
