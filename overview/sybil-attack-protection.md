# Sybil attack protection

In Bitcoin, obtaining the hash needed to link the newly created block to the existing chain requires many calculations that cannot be faked - otherwise such a hack could be used to create much more efficient computers. This makes mining with the Proof of Work consensus fair.

{% hint style="info" %}
We define 'fair mining' as a reward system where the most profitable strategy is to play by the rules, as it is impossible to profit by circumventing them.
{% endhint %}

However, such fair mining is difficult to achieve without Proof of Work. For example, if the system rewards users for completing quests, fake completions can easily be generated by code from many accounts (a form of Sybil attack), and the system will not be able to distinguish such fakes from real user completions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Perhaps in the future AI will evolve to the point where it can become an infallible judge, but for now it is more robust to use the algorithm that blindly uses a set of rules and the numbers given as input to distribute the reward among the miners.
{% endhint %}

The problem is that if it's possible to sell a generated fake into the system, the real value, which takes effort to create, can't compete with the fakes, which are created by thousands in a second. In the end, only fakes will be added to the system, because the reward for each unit of value will be so small that it will not make sense to put effort into creating a real value.

One of the most common solutions that has been tried in recent years to prevent fraud in the absence of Proof of Work is to use the limits of human nature itself. From various KYC systems with confirmation in the form of NFT, to all sorts of pedometers and tappers on mobile devices.

However, none of these approaches have been successful because developers are trying to solve the same problem as Proof of Work - rewarding only those miners who create real value. But unless the system can easily distinguish between real and fake value, and users consume a finite resource while mining, this problem is unsolvable.

A phone or NFT allows a user to automate the necessary actions or scale the mining power across many accounts, as each is a one-time cost. Furthermore, KYC accounts are sold in bundles for pennies, while building a farm of thousands of phones is not difficult or expensive these days.

So at the moment there is no real approach to fair mining other than Proof of Work, and today's teams prefer to take the easy way out and mint all the tokens for themselves at once and then sell them to the crowd.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is actually nothing new. At the dawn of the stock market more than 150 years ago, anyone could issue their own securities and sell them to the public through newspaper advertisements.
{% endhint %}

However, this does not mean that fair mining is impossible outside the Proof of Work consensus - we just need to look at the problem from a different angle. And all we have to do is change the goal slightly - from "don't reward cheaters" to "don't reward cheaters at the expense of good users".

In Questfall, this goal is achieved through three key mechanics:&#x20;

* community moderation in form of voting ([read more](../quest-mining/community-moderation.md));
* user levels that increase the efficiency of mining ([read more](../quest-mining/user-levels.md));
* fixed rewards for each floor of the levels pyramid ([read more](../quest-mining/user-rewards.md)).

Community moderation helps the system to distinguish between fake quest completions and real ones through user voting. In this way, the problem of protecting the system from fakes is shifted from completions to voting.&#x20;

In fact, such a vote is a community consensus on each of the completions, and like any other consensus, it is vulnerable to Sybil attacks. And since the main protection against such attacks is hierarchy, user levels play a crucial role in Questfall.

Users can progress through the levels if their votes are mostly in line with the majority of other voters. More specifically, if they vote the same as the majority, users are rewarded - they gain XP which allows them to level up, otherwise they are penalised - the amount of XP needed to get to the next level increases.

{% hint style="info" %}
There are other rules for voting, not so important ([read all the details](../quest-mining/community-moderation.md))
{% endhint %}

One key aspect of protection is that the majority is weighted, which means that votes are not equal - the higher the level of the user, the more weight his vote has. In other words, the more correctly a user votes, the more power he has. This makes it impossible for a large number of new accounts to be registered and used to manipulate the voting results, as high level users will protect the voting from abuse and as a result such new accounts will be punished.

Another key factor is that while validating quest completions can easily be done by hand for free, automating it with code requires ongoing costs. Even if we leave aside the problem of distinguishing fake completions in order to vote properly (which will require a pretty smart AI), there is another problem. The majority of completions will be in the form of content on third party platforms (like X, Youtube, Facebok, Discord, etc) and these platforms ban bots to prevent DDoS attacks and content parsing.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, there is only one official way to access tweets with the code - [a paid API](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/x-api/getting-started/about-x-api).
{% endhint %}

As a result common user can easily earn XP to level up by voting for completions, while malicious actors who want to get and edge with bots will have on-going costs for AI to properly judge the completions and to overcome the protection against bots on popular platforms. In other words, progressing through levels requiers efforts or money and as a result users form a pyramid, as the higher the level, the fewer users will have it.&#x20;

And the last brick in the wall is that the rewards for different user levels are fixed and do not depend on the activity on other levels. So raising a level allows a user to mine more with the same mining power as the competition lowers with each level. As a result, if a good miner is earning too little for his efforts, all he has to do is level up by adding value to the system in the form of moderation or QFT burning.

{% hint style="info" %}
The share of bots will decrease with each level, as XP gain cannot be automated without ongoing costs, and as a result it is more profitable to invest money in one account to level it up, and earn with less competition than to compete with own bots.
{% endhint %}

This approach assumes that there are no restrictions on the mining process, only different levels of competition depending on the performance of each user. This means that multiple accounts and bots can be used to scale mining power during quest mining.

But the leveling system protects good users from being influenced by bad ones, because users form a pyramid with their levels. The higher the level, the fewer users will have it. So it is possible that there will be a lot of bots on the first level, but the higher the level of the user, the fewer competitors there will be on the same level of the pyramid, including bots.

Crucially, the rewards for different levels are fixed and do not depend on the number of users at other levels. So tenth level users will only be competing with each other for a fixed reward that does not depend on the number or mining power of first level users (or bots).

{% hint style="info" %}
This approach can be compared to the independent sections of a submarine. Read the article about [User rewards](../quest-mining/user-rewards.md) for more details.
