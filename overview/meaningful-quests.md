# Meaningful Quests

### Meaningful quests

The vast majority of projects on the existing quest platforms do not put a lot of resources into creating quests, and as a result, most of them are silly tasks like joining Discord or reposting a tweet.

This happens because projects are primarily interested in promoting themselves, and quest platforms give them access to the userbase without any demands on the quality of the quests. As a result, project teams simply take the most efficient path that requires the least effort.

On the other hand, quest mining in Questfall is based on rewarding authors according to the value they bring to the community. In order to estimate the value created by authors, users who complete a particular quest are rewarded for voting on its rating, thus influencing the author's reward.

In order to prevent malicious authors from abusing the rating system, votes will be weighted differently depending on the level of the user. Read more in the [Ratings](../author-mining/ratings.md) article.
{% endhint %}

In this way, authors who create content that is highly rated by the community will be rewarded for doing so. In other words, authors can be rewarded for publishing their books, articles, lessons, music, pictures, videos and so on.&#x20;

Quests such as '_Read the new chapter of my book and answer the question_' could become a new paradigm for making money from the creation of intellectual products in today's economy.

Moreover, since the motivation for users is provided by the system, and authors do not have to worry about it, they can create quests that will make a world a better place. For example, users can be rewarded for completing quests such as 'Plant a tree' or 'Clean up the ocean'.

Quest mining rewards are not biased, and users are paid by the system itself, not by projects or other users. This makes it possible to make the world a better place through quests, as the motivation for users is provided by the system, and authors do not have to worry about it. For example, users can be rewarded for completing quests such as 'Plant a tree' or 'Clean up the ocean'.

Of course, this approach also opens up the possibility of quests causing harm to others, as the system blindly motivates users to complete every quest. However, this problem is addressed by [decentralised moderation](../user-mining/levels.md), where the community decides whether a reported quest is appropriate or not.

### Global quest feed

None of the existing quest platforms have implemented quest mining, so it is assumed that their users receive rewards from the particular projects they do quests for. This approach not only makes user rewards arbitrary and optional, but also forces users to focus on a few specific projects, skipping many other activities on the platform.

Global rewards from the system, thanks to quest mining, allow Questfall to have a global quest feed, which is the direct analogue to the post feed in any social media platform. The only difference is the depth of user interaction with the content. If the social media format does not require a mandatory response to the post, a quest will need some proof that a user has taken a requested action.

This makes Questfall similar to sites like Facebook or Tweeter.
{% endhint %}

The global quest feed not only allows users to keep up with what is happening on Questfall, but it also helps projects to promote their quests to all users of the platform, since the system can influence the visibility of quests in the feed.&#x20;

Promoting quests requires adding value to the entire community. Read more in the [Promotion](../author-mining/promotion.md) article.
