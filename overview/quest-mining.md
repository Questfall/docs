# Quest mining

Mining, first implemented in Bitcoin, creates an economy completely different from modern capitalism by establishing a direct link between investment in the system and its development.

While high demand for a particular security on the stock market allows only the founders of a company to cash out with a profit or speculators to make money, the high price of cryptocurrency ensures the profitability of mining, attracts new participants and, in the case of Proof of Work, makes the blockchain more secure.

{% hint style="info" %}
Here and throughout, we take mining in a more abstract sense than just brute forcing a hash in Proof of Work. By mining we mean tokenomics, where tokens with a limited total supply are periodically issued in decreasing amounts, determined by a pre-defined formula, and distributed to users according to the value they add to the system.
{% endhint %}

The mining approach has been very successful because it allows newly issued coins to be obtained for valuable actions, such as creating a new block in the chain, without having to pay for a cryptocurrency. And if we assume that such valuable actions can actually be anything, then the mining concept fits perfectly into a quest mining concept.&#x20;

So it's no surprise that Questfall is built around the concept of mining, which means that the system rewards users with a decreasing number of Questfall Tokens (QFT) each week for various quest-related and infrastructure-supporting actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each QFT token is mined, i.e. used to reward valuable actions when issued, and is not pre-minted by the Team.
{% endhint %}

There is no way to compare the creation of a quest and the provision of liquidity to the DEX pool, so the QFT issue is divided into pre-determined shares between different areas. It can be thought of as different mining pools, each receiving a fixed percentage of the weekly issue and distributing rewards to users based on the comparative value they bring to the system.

{% hint style="info" %}
As the percentage split is fixed, and the QFT issue is determined by the pre-defined formula, the number of tokens allocated to each of these pools can be accurately calculated for any given week.
{% endhint %}

In Questfall, 66% of the weekly issue is used to reward quest miners:

* 40% to users who complete quests,
* 10% to authors who create quests,
* 16% to seasonal reward pool (11.2% to users and 4.8% to authors).

The remaining 34% is used to reward infrastructure support:

* 2% to users who burn their Mining NFTs or Founder NFTs,
* 8% to users who provide liquidity to the official DEX pool,
* 5% to users who freeze their QFT tokens,
* 4% to users who burn their QFT tokens to get Credits,
* 5% to the Team for project expenses,
* 10% to Founders.

The principles for valuing user contributions can vary from one pool to another. For example, liquidity providers are rewarded based on their share of the pool, while authors are rewarded based on their quest ratings and popularity.

### Motivation for quality quests

The vast majority of projects on the existing quest platforms do not put a lot of resources into creating quests, and as a result, most of them are silly tasks like joining Discord or reposting a Tweet.&#x20;

This happens because projects are primarily interested in promoting themselves, and quest platforms give them access to the userbase without any demands on the quality of the quests. As a result, project teams simply take the most efficient path that requires the least effort.

Thanks to quest mining, Questfall is able to reward authors for the quality of their quests. In order to do this, every user will be rewarded for voting on the rating of the quests he has completed, which will affect the author's reward.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to prevent malicious authors from abusing the rating system, votes will be weighted differently depending on the level of the user. Read more in the [Quest Ratings](../quest-mining/quest-rating.md) article.
{% endhint %}

In this way, authors who create content that is highly rated by the community will be rewarded for doing so. In other words, authors can be rewarded for publishing their books, articles, lessons, music, pictures, videos and so on.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Quests such as '_Read the new chapter of my book and answer the question_' could become a new paradigm for making money from the creation of intellectual products in today's economy.
{% endhint %}

### Global quest feed

None of the existing quest platforms have implemented quest mining, so it is assumed that their users receive rewards from the particular projects they do quests for. This approach not only makes user rewards arbitrary and optional, but also forces users to focus on a few specific projects, skipping many other activities on the platform.

Global rewards from the system, thanks to quest mining, allow Questfall to have a global quest feed, which is the direct analogue to the post feed in any social media platform. The only difference is the depth of user interaction with the content. If the social media format does not require a mandatory response to the post, a quest will need some proof that a user has taken a requested action.

{% hint style="info" %}
This makes Questfall similar to sites like Facebook or Tweeter.
{% endhint %}

The global quest feed not only allows users to keep up with what is happening on Questfall, but it also helps projects to promote their quests to all users of the platform, since the system can influence the visibility of quests in the feed.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Promoting quests requires adding value to the entire community. Read more in the [Quest Promotion](../quest-mining/quest-promotion.md) article.
{% endhint %}

### Real-world quests

Quest mining rewards are not biased, and users are paid by the system itself, not by projects or other users. This means that anyone can use Questfall not only to make money, but also to make the world a better place.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, users can benefit for creating such quests as 'Plant a tree' or 'Clean the Ocean'.
{% endhint %}

However, there is a downside to this approach: since quests are not pre-moderated, they can be used for evil purposes. For example, quests such as 'Kill an animal' or 'Say nasty things about this company' may appear. To prevent potential harm to others, any user can report a quest and the [community will vote](../quest-mining/community-moderation.md) on whether or not it is appropriate.
