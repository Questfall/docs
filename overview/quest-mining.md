# Quest Mining

Mining, first implemented in Bitcoin, creates an economy completely different from modern capitalism by establishing a direct link between investment in the system and its development.

While high demand for a particular security on the stock market only allows the founders of a company to cash out at a profit or speculators to make money, the high price of cryptocurrency ensures the profitability of mining, attracting new miners who add more value to the system and, in the case of Proof of Work, making the blockchain more secure as a result.

{% hint style="info" %}
Here and throughout, we take mining in a more abstract sense than just brute forcing a hash in Proof of Work. By mining we mean tokenomics, where tokens with a limited total supply are periodically issued in decreasing amounts, determined by a pre-defined formula, and distributed to users according to the value they add to the system.
{% endhint %}

The mining approach has been very successful because it allows newly issued coins to be obtained for valuable actions, such as creating a new block in the chain, without having to pay for them. And if we assume that such valuable actions can actually be anything, then the concept of mining fits in perfectly with the quests.

So it's no surprise that Questfall is built around the concept of mining, which means that the system rewards users with a decreasing number of Questfall Tokens (QFT) each week for various quest and infrastructure actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each QFT token is issued as a user reward for valuable actions, and none are pre-minted by the Team.
{% endhint %}

Quest mining requires different activities to be rewarded, and this creates a problem because there is no way to compare, for example, creating a quest and providing liquidity to the DEX pool.&#x20;

Therefore, QFT issue is divided into pre-determined proportions between different areas. It can be thought of as different mining pools, each receiving a fixed percentage of the weekly issue and distributing rewards to users based on the comparative value they bring to the system.

{% hint style="info" %}
As the percentage split is fixed, and the QFT issue is determined by the pre-defined formula, the number of tokens allocated to each of these pools can be accurately calculated for any given week.
{% endhint %}

In Questfall, a third of the weekly issue (34%) is used to support the infrastructure:

* 1% to buy back and burn Founder NFTs;
* 5% to reward liquidity providers;
* 5% to reward QFT freezing;
* 5% to cover project costs (Team);
* 8% to cover Gold withdrawals;
* 10% to Founders.

{% hint style="info" %}
Details of the reward distribution in each of these pools can be found in the relevant articles.
{% endhint %}

The remaining two-thirds of the weekly issue (66%) is used to reward the quest miners:

* 40% to users who complete quests;
* 10% to authors who create quests;
* 16% to seasonal reward pool (11.2% to users and 4.8% to authors).

At the end of each week or season, rewards for completing quests are distributed based on a user's mining score, which acts like a personal mining power. This mining score is simply the total number of mining points a user earns by completing quests during the period.

Each quest is worth a certain number of mining points, which all users who complete the quest will receive as a basic reward. However, while the basic reward for the quest is the same for all users, the final number of mining points received can be increased by individual user bonuses.

{% hint style="info" %}
Individual bonuses are based on the [RPG System](rpg-system.md).
{% endhint %}

The number of mining points users receive as a basic reward for a given quest is based on the quest author's reputation, which is simply a moving average of the community ratings of that author's quests.&#x20;

In other words, the higher the ratings of the author's quests, the higher his reputation, and the more mining points will be used to reward his future quests.

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to prevent malicious authors from abusing the rating system, votes are weighted differently depending on the user level. Read more in the [Ratings](../authors/ratings.md) article.
{% endhint %}

This way, authors with a higher reputation will create more rewarding quests, which will motivate users to complete them. And since the author's mining power is represented by the number of quests users complete in a week or season, an author's reward is directly affected by his reputation.

This approach makes quest quality the cornerstone of the system, as the most profitable strategy for authors is to create fun, educational or entertaining quests that are appreciated by the community, while users are motivated to complete quests created by the most diligent authors.
