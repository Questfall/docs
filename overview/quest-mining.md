# ⚒️ Quest mining

Mining means that tokens with a limited total supply are periodically issued in decreasing amounts, determined by a pre-defined formula, and distributed to users according to the value they add to the system. This approach was first implemented in Bitcoin and became very successful.

The main advantage of mining is that it creates a direct link between investment in the cryptocurrency and the development of the system. Whereas high demand for a particular security on the stock market allows only the founders of a company to cash out with a profit or speculators to make money, the high price of BTC ensures the profitability of mining, attracting new participants and making the blockchain more secure.

But the key success factor that created the whole crypto phenomenon was that BTC could be obtained without paying for it. Paying for cryptocurrency adds value to people, while getting cryptocurrency produced by the computer system for the user's valuable actions is much more meaningful. If we assume that valuable actions are not limited to hash brute forcing and can actually be anything, then the mining concept fits perfectly into a quest platform.

So, it's no surprise that Questfall is built around the idea of quest mining, which means that the system rewards users with a decreasing number of Questfall Tokens (QFT) each week for various quest-related and infrastructure-supporting actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [QFT token](../assets/questfall-tokens-qft.md) is described in detail in another article, for now we just want to emphasize that every QFT token is mined - none are pre-minted by the Team.
{% endhint %}

### Reward distribution by pools

There is no way to compare the creation of a quest and the provision of liquidity to the DEX pool, so the QFT issue is divided into pre-determined shares between different areas. This can be thought of as different mining pools, each with its own fixed percentage of the issue, where users compete by providing comparable value.

{% hint style="info" %}
As the percentage split is fixed, and the QFT issue is also known in advance, the number of tokens for each area can be accurately calculated for a given week.
{% endhint %}

In Questfall, 66% of the weekly issue is used to reward quest miners:

* 40% to users who complete quests,
* 10% to authors who create quests,
* 6% to authors who create challenges,
* 10% to seasonal reward pool.

The remaining 34% is used to reward infrastructure support:

* 2% to users who burn their Miners NFTs or Founders NFTs,
* 8% to users who provide liquidity to the official DEX pool,
* 5% to users who freeze their QFT tokens,
* 4% to users who burn their QFT tokens to get Credits,
* 5% to the Team for project expenses,
* 10% to Founders.

The principles by which the value contributed by users is estimated can vary from one area to another. For example, liquidity providers are rewarded based on their share of the pool, while authors - based on their quest ratings and popularity.

### Motivation for quality quests

Most of the projects on the existing quest platforms do not put a lot of resources into creating quests, and as a result, most of them are dumb tasks like joining Discord or reposting a Tweet. This happens because projects are primarily interested in promoting themselves, and quest platforms give them access to the userbase without any demands on the quality of the quests. As a result, project teams will simply take the most efficient route, using as little effort as possible.

Thanks to quest mining, Questfall is able to reward authors for the quality of their quests. To do this, every user is forced to vote on the quality of the quest after completing it. This rating will be used to calculate the reward for the quest author - the higher the rating, the bigger the reward for the author.

{% hint style="info" %}
A quest rating is actually not just a user's opinion on the quality of a quest, as it can be abused. Voting for the rating uses the "majority recursion" principle, which is described in detail in the [PoH consensus](anti-cheat-system.md) article.
{% endhint %}

In this way, authors who create content that is highly rated by the community will be rewarded for doing so. In other words, authors can be rewarded for publishing their books, articles, lessons, music, pictures, videos and so on. Quests such as 'Read the new chapter of my book and answer the question' could become a new paradigm for making money from the creation of intellectual products in today's economy.

### Global quest feed

None of the existing quest platforms have implemented quest mining, so it is assumed that their users will receive rewards from the particular projects they do quests for. This approach not only makes user rewards arbitrary and optional, but also makes it pointless to spread effort across quests from different projects.

Global rewards from the system, thanks to quest mining, allow Questfall to have a global quest feed, which is the direct analogue to the post feed in any social media platform. The only difference is the depth of user interaction with the content. If the social media format does not require a mandatory response to the post, a quest will need some proof that a user has taken a certain action.

{% hint style="info" %}
This makes Questfall similar to sites like Facebook or Tweeter.
{% endhint %}

The global quest feed not only allows users to keep up with what is happening on Questfall, but it also helps projects to promote their quests to all users of the platform, since the system can influence the visibility of quests in the feed.&#x20;

However, promoting a quest is not just about getting a certain spot in the global feed for a fee. To promote a quest, an author should spend Credits on the quest points that users will receive when they complete the quest. This means that promoted quests are not only more visible, but also more attractive for users to complete.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since Credits can only be obtained by burning QFT (at a fixed price of $1), promoting quests forces [QFT deflation](deflation-due-usage.md), which adds value to the entire community.
{% endhint %}

This way, the feed algorithm will push the most rated or promoted quests to the top, making quests that do not add value to the community less popular and allowing users to focus on quests that are educational, fun or offer a higher reward.

### Real-world quests

Quest mining rewards are not biased, and users are paid by the system itself, not by projects or other users. This means that anyone can use Questfall not only to make money, but also to make the world a better place. The only requirement for such quests is that they are appreciated by the community.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, our Team will create the ongoing 'Plant a tree' quest right from the start. Since most oxygen is produced by algae, our second quest of this type would be 'Clean the Ocean'.
{% endhint %}

However, there is a downside to this approach: since quests are not pre-moderated, they can be used for evil purposes. For example, quests such as 'Kill an animal' or 'Say nasty things about this company' may appear. To prevent potential harm to others, any user can complain about a particular quest, and the community will decide by [consensus ](anti-cheat-system.md)whether it is appropriate or not.

{% hint style="info" %}
But this complaint mechanism could also be used by evil to punish good quests. To prevent this, the following logic will apply: if the community decides that the complaints are not justified, the complainants will be punished by reducing their humanity, otherwise the quest will be banned, and the complainants will receive a humanity bonus.
