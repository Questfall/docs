# Quest Mining

Mining, first implemented in Bitcoin, creates an economy completely different from modern capitalism by establishing a direct link between investment in the system and its development.

While high demand for a particular security on the stock market only allows the founders of a company to cash out at a profit or speculators to make money, the high price of cryptocurrency ensures the profitability of mining, attracting new miners who add more value to the system and, in the case of Proof of Work, making the blockchain more secure as a result.

{% hint style="info" %}
Here and throughout, we take mining in a more abstract sense than just brute forcing a hash in Proof of Work. By mining we mean tokenomics, where tokens with a limited total supply are periodically issued in decreasing amounts, determined by a pre-defined formula, and distributed to users according to the value they add to the system.
{% endhint %}

The mining approach has been very successful because it allows newly issued coins to be obtained for valuable actions, such as creating a new block in the chain, without having to pay for them. And if we assume that such valuable actions can actually be anything, then the concept of mining fits in perfectly with the quests.

So it's no surprise that Questfall is built around the concept of mining, which means that the system rewards users with a decreasing number of Questfall Tokens (QFT) each week for various quest and infrastructure actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each QFT token is mined, i.e. it is used to reward valuable actions when it is issued. It is not pre-minted by the Team.
{% endhint %}

Quest mining requires different activities to be rewarded, and this creates a problem because there is no way to compare, for example, creating a quest and providing liquidity to the DEX pool.&#x20;

Therefore, QFT issue is divided into pre-determined proportions between different areas. It can be thought of as different mining pools, each receiving a fixed percentage of the weekly issue and distributing rewards to users based on the comparative value they bring to the system.

{% hint style="info" %}
As the percentage split is fixed, and the QFT issue is determined by the pre-defined formula, the number of tokens allocated to each of these pools can be accurately calculated for any given week.
{% endhint %}

In Questfall, 66% of the weekly issue is used to reward quest miners:

* 40% to users who complete quests;
* 10% to authors who create quests;
* 16% to seasonal reward pool (11.2% to users and 4.8% to authors).

The remaining 34% is used to support infrastructure:

* 1% to buy back and burn Founder NFTs;
* 5% to reward liquidity providers;
* 5% to reward QFT freezing;
* 5% to cover project costs (Team);
* 8% to cover Gold withdrawals;
* 10% to Founders.

The principles for valuing user contributions can vary from one pool to another.

For example, the most important and most rewarded activity (40% + 4.8% of the weekly issue) is quest completion. Completing each quest earns users different amounts of ACT points, depending on the author's [reputation](../author-mining/reputation.md), the quest's [promotion](../author-mining/promotion.md), the character's [garment](../user-mining/items.md) and even [magic](../user-mining/magic.md).

ACT points increase a user's activity score, which can be thought of as a user's mining power, and is used at the end of the week or season to calculate the user's share of the quest completion pool reward.

On the other hand, the author's mining power is calculated based on the popularity of his quests. In other words, each completion of an author's quests during a week or season is added up and used as the author's share of the reward.

An author can increase the number of quests completed not only by promoting his quests, but more importantly by creating quests that are appreciated by the community, as the higher the author's reputation, the more ACT points users will receive for completing his quests. In this way, the higher the [ratings ](../author-mining/ratings.md)of the author's quests, the more motivated users will be to complete them.
