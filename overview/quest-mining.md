# Quest Mining

Mining, first implemented in Bitcoin, creates an economy completely different from modern capitalism by establishing a direct link between investment in the system and its development.

While high demand for a particular security on the stock market only allows the founders of a company to cash out at a profit or speculators to make money, the high price of cryptocurrency ensures the profitability of mining, attracting new miners who add more value to the system and, in the case of Proof of Work, making the blockchain more secure as a result.

{% hint style="info" %}
Here and throughout, we take mining in a more abstract sense than just brute forcing a hash in Proof of Work. By mining we mean tokenomics, where tokens with a limited total supply are periodically issued in decreasing amounts, determined by a pre-defined formula, and distributed to users according to the value they add to the system.
{% endhint %}

The mining approach has been very successful because it allows newly issued coins to be obtained for valuable actions, such as creating a new block in the chain, without having to pay for them. And if we assume that such valuable actions can actually be anything, then the concept of mining fits in perfectly with the quests.

So it's no surprise that Questfall is built around the concept of mining, which means that the system rewards users with a decreasing number of Questfall Tokens (QFT) each week for various quest and infrastructure actions.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each QFT token is mined, i.e. it is used to reward valuable actions when it is issued. It is not pre-minted by the Team.
{% endhint %}

Quest mining requires different activities to be rewarded, and this creates a problem because there is no way to compare, for example, creating a quest and providing liquidity to the DEX pool.&#x20;

Therefore, QFT issue is divided into pre-determined proportions between different areas. It can be thought of as different mining pools, each receiving a fixed percentage of the weekly issue and distributing rewards to users based on the comparative value they bring to the system.

{% hint style="info" %}
As the percentage split is fixed, and the QFT issue is determined by the pre-defined formula, the number of tokens allocated to each of these pools can be accurately calculated for any given week.
{% endhint %}

In Questfall, a third of the weekly issue (34%) is used to support the infrastructure:

* 1% to buy back and burn Founder NFTs;
* 5% to reward liquidity providers;
* 5% to reward QFT freezing;
* 5% to cover project costs (Team);
* 8% to cover Gold withdrawals;
* 10% to Founders.

{% hint style="info" %}
Details of the reward distribution in each of these pools can be found in the relevant articles.
{% endhint %}

The remaining two-thirds of the weekly issue (66%) is used to reward the quest miners:

* 40% to users who complete quests;
* 10% to authors who create quests;
* 16% to seasonal reward pool (11.2% to users and 4.8% to authors).

The overall approach to reward distribution at the end of a week or season for completing quests is based on user activity, which can be thought of as individual mining power. This activity score is calculated as the sum of the ACT points earned by a given user by completing quests during the period.

Each quest has its own pre-determined ACT reward based on the reputation of the quest author and the quest promotion. While all users will receive the same amount of ACT points from the same quest, the reward can be further adjusted based on the user's individual bonuses from items and magic.

The author's mining power, on the other hand, is based on the popularity of his quests. In other words, the author's share of the reward is determined by how many users complete his quests in a week or season.

An author can increase his reward by gaining a reputation for creating quests that are appreciated by the community, as the higher the author's reputation, the more ACT points users will receive for completing his quests.

{% hint style="info" %}
Authors can also promote their quests by adding ACT points directly to their quests by paying for them in a way that adds value to the entire community. See the [Promotion ](../author-mining/promotion.md)article for more details.
{% endhint %}

The increased amount of ACT points users receive for completing a particular quest not only makes it more attractive to complete, but also makes it more visible in the system thanks to the global quest feed.
