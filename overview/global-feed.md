# Quest Feed

The workflow of existing quest platforms assumes that users receive rewards directly from quest authors. Such an approach forces users to focus on a few specific authors (projects teams) while skipping others, as there is no point in completing just one quest from a particular author, as the reward usually requires the completion of all of the author's quests.

This approach not only makes user rewards arbitrary and optional, but also makes authors monopolists who may not care about the quality of their quests. In addition, teams spend their own resources and see project promotion as the only value in return.

As a result, the vast majority of project teams on existing quest platforms simply take the most efficient route, which requires the least amount of effort, to create quests. That is why most quests are silly tasks like joining Discord or reposting a tweet.

Quest mining, on the other hand, assumes that users are not tied to authors - on the contrary, authors compete with each other for the attention of users, who are free to choose quests created by different authors from a single system pool.

In Questfall, such a pool of quests is called the Quest Feed, which is the direct analogue to a post feed on any social media platform. The only difference is that the social media format does not require a mandatory reaction to the post, whereas a quest requires some proof that a user has taken a requested action.

This makes Questfall similar to sites like Facebook or X.

The Quest Feed can be thought of as a virtual exhibition where authors compete for the attention of users over the long term. The more consistently high quality quests authors create, the easier it will be for them to reach the mainstream audience in the future, and the more they will earn.

This creates a very different paradigm, where instead of spending resources on motivating users, authors are rewarded according to the value they bring to the community.

In other words, authors can earn by publishing their books, articles, lessons, music, pictures, videos and so on. Quests such as '_Read the new chapter of my book and answer the question_' could become a new paradigm for making money from the creation of intellectual products in today's economy.

This approach also makes it possible to make the world a better place through quests. For example, a high reputation author could create a quest to plant a tree or clean up an ocean, and that quest could work as a flash mob.

Of course, this approach also opens up the possibility of quests causing harm to others. This problem is addressed by[ decentralised moderation](broken-reference), where the community decides whether a reported quest is appropriate or not.

In addition, the concepts of Quest Mining and Quest Feed do not eliminate the existing approach of teams spending resources to promote their projects. Project teams can do this by increasing the base reward of their quests, which will make the quest more visible in the Quest Feed, since it is primarily sorted by quest rewards.&#x20;

Of course, such a promotion will not be free and will require QFT burning, thus adding value to the entire community by making QFT a deflationary token.
