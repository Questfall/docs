# Public Ownership

One of the main characteristics of consciousness, besides self-awareness, is having self-interest, the latter being the result of the former. This self-interest is what is usually called the human factor.

As a result, people can create systems with rules, but when things go wrong (which they usually do sooner or later), they can change the rules to suit their own interests. This happens everywhere in our culture - from economics to religion to physics.

When there is not enough money, most governments just print more. When the doctrine of religion does not fit with economics, priests change the doctrine and allow interest on loans. Or if something does not fit into the model of the universe, scientists will introduce dark matter or dark energy just to keep all the previous regalities and grants received intact.

What makes Bitcoin unique is that it is the first man-made system where there is no owner who controls the system and can change the rules for personal gain.

{% hint style="info" %}
Before that, only the laws of physics were such a system. But they are not created by man.
{% endhint %}

However, it is almost impossible to create a perfect system on the first try. For example, Bitcoin had a bug that allowed an arbitrary number of BTCs to be printed. A bug in block #74638 allowed the creation of 184 billion BTCs due to an integer overflow. Developers, including Satoshi Nakamoto, quickly patched it with v0.3.10, deleting the invalid transaction and maintaining the 21M BTC cap.

The problem was solved by soft forking, which was only possible because there were not many users, most of whom read the same forum every day. Today, such a soft fork would be orders of magnitude more difficult to implement.

This example perfectly illustrates the paradox that ownerless systems introduce. On the one hand, someone should control the system in order to develop the project and fix bugs, and on the other hand, this prevents the system from being ownerless.

The simplest approach is to polish the system as much as possible before launching it in a decentralized way. But this approach only works for the simpler systems, not for a complex system like Questfall.

{% hint style="info" %}
For this reason, there are no projects based on smart contracts that are as popular as traditional web projects. Either a project is controlled by its developers or it does not evolve over time.
{% endhint %}

In Questfall, thanks to the mining approach, we solved this problem by making the core functionality controlled by the Team, while implementing the most important parts of the tokenomics ownerless.

More specifically, while the code controlled by the team that distributes the weekly rewards can theoretically be changed and the team can take all of the weekly issuance for themselves, the amount of QFTs issued in a given week is set in stone in the smart contract whose ownership is burned.

Even better, the liquidity ownership in the swap pool is also burned by the users, making it impossible not only to rug pull with unlimited issuance, but also to withdraw liquidity by anyone.

{% endhint %}

This approach does not prevent the Team from being stupid and doing malicious things, but we would not be able to take all the value out of the system immediately.&#x20;

The Team can only mess with a week's worth of issuance, which will be immediately noticed by users, allowing them to extract value since the Team will only be able to get a small fraction of it.

{% hint style="info" %}
We believe that at some point the Team will be made up entirely of employees, and we as co-founders, along with other [Founder NFTs](../assets/founder-nfts.md) owners, have an interest in ensuring that the system is secure against the malicious actions of the Team.
{% endhint %}

As a result, while the Team can develop the project by implementing new features and fixing bugs, the core of the tokenomics is decentralized and cannot be changed by anyone, including the Team.&#x20;

The amount of QFT issued each week, the reward share of various activities, and the liquidity backing the QFT value are set in stone in the smart contracts whose ownership is burned.
