# ðŸ’š Quest quality reward

Most of the projects on the existing quest platforms do not put a lot of resources into creating quests, and as a result, most of them are dumb tasks like joining Discord or reposting a Tweet. This happens because projects are primarily interested in promoting themselves, and quest platforms give them access to the userbase without any demands on the quality of the quests, which require a lot of effort. So, project teams simply take the most efficient route.

Thanks to the mining approach, Questfall is able to reward authors for the quality of their quests. To do this, every user will be forced to vote on the quest's quality rating after completing the quest. This rating will be used to calculate the reward for the quest author - the more the public rates the quest, the higher the reward for the author.

In this way, authors who create content that is highly valued by the community will be rewarded for doing so. In other words, authors will be able to be rewarded for publishing their books, articles, lessons, music, images, videos and so on. Quests such as 'Read the new chapter of my book and answer the question' could become a new paradigm for making money from the creation of intellectual products in today's economy.
