# ðŸ“° Global quest feed

Existing quest platforms either have no tokenomics at all, or very weak tokenomics, so it is assumed that users receive rewards from the particular projects they do quests for. This approach not only makes user rewards arbitrary and optional, but also makes it pointless to spread effort across quests from different projects.

A mining approach accompanied by deflationary tokenonimcs on the one hand allows users to mine quests from any project thanks to the global rewards, and on the other hand the amount of QFT teams will be willing to burn to promote their quests depends strictly on the size of the userbase. These two aspects make the global quest feed not just a feature, but a necessity.

The global quest feed is the direct analogue to the post feed in any social media platform. Not only does it allow users to keep up with what is happening on Questfall, but it also helps projects to promote their quests to all users of the platform at once.

{% hint style="info" %}
This makes Questfall similar to any social media site like Facebook or Tweeter. The only difference is the depth of user interaction with the content. If the social media format does not require a mandatory response to the post, a quest will need some proof that a user has taken a certain action.
{% endhint %}

Quest promotion is not just about getting a certain spot in the global feed for a payment. All quests reward users with the same (default) amount of Mining Points. Promoting a quest means that an author adds a multiplier to this default amount by burning Credits. The more Credits burned, the higher the multiplier. This means that promoted quests are not only more visible, but also more attractive to mine.

In this way, the global quest feed will show users quests sorted by two parameters - rating and profitability. The most visible quests will be either those that are highly rated by those who have completed them or promoted quests that have brought value to the entire community by burning QFT (through Credits).
