# ðŸ“° - Global quest feed

The quest platform is not that different from the any social media like Facebook or Tweeter. The only difference is the depth of the user reaction to the post. If social media format assumes only emoji reactions to the post, a quest will need some proof of its completion (that the user has taken demanded action).

That is why the global quest feed is the straightforward analogous of the post feed in any social media. This approach not only allows a user to be in the trend of what is happening on the platform, but it also allows projects to promote their quests to the public by burning some QFT.
