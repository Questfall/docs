# Deflationary tokenomics

While the mining approach has worked very well in Bitcoin so far, it has a major problem in the long run. There is a growing imbalance between the reward given to miners and the value held by holders.

When the Bitcoin blockchain started, each reward for a block gave miners a tangible share of the circulating supply, but today there are nearly 20 million BTCs in circulation, and the remaining 1 million+ will be mined over the next 125 years. As a result, miners get a smaller and smaller share of the circulating supply, and since they are rewarded by issuing BTCs that gain value by taking it away from existing holders, their share of Bitcoin's capitalisation shrinks over time.

This could be compared to the finances of a company in the real world, and how income is divided between salaries for employees and dividends for shareholders. If the simplified mining mechanism implemented in Bitcoin is applied to a real company, dividends as a percentage of total income will grow steadily over time until it reaches 100%. Not only does this seem unfair, but it is also dangerous for the system, as workers will eventually not earn enough.

{% hint style="info" %}
Bitcoin assumes that miners will only earn from transaction fees once BTCs are no longer issued in 2140, but this is a very different economic model and no one knows in advance whether it will work or not.
{% endhint %}

Deflation can solve this problem, as burning tokens reduces the supply in circulation, thus increasing the miners' share. But burning for nothing causes losses, and therefore only makes sense for altruists who benefit others at the expense of their own interests. In other words, for a deflationary model to work, the system should give something in return for burnt tokens.

In Questfall, users can burn QFT tokens to gain one of three benefits:&#x20;

* authors can attract users to their quests through promotion ([read more](../quest-mining/quest-promotion.md));
* users can increase their mining power by minting Mining NFT ([read more](../assets/miners-nft.md));
* users can level up without participating in moderation ([read more](../quest-mining/user-levels.md)).

{% hint style="info" %}
These benefits can be purchased with off-chain Credits, which can only be obtained by burning QFT at a fixed price of $1. See the [Credits](../assets/credits-off-chain.md) article for more details.
{% endhint %}

In this way, QFT tokens are issued each week to reward miners, while at the same time they are burned for Credits. This dialectic has several advantages.

Firstly, it solves the inherent problem of Bitcoin's approach to mining, as the miners' share of the system's capitalisation tends to be stable over the long term. In other words, the portion of QFT's capitalisation that is used to reward miners will not decrease despite the decline in token issuance.

The defaltionary nature of QFT also implies that the number of tokens in circulation will initially increase as there are no tokens to begin with, but as the market saturates, the number of QFTs in circulation will slowly decrease over time.&#x20;

This means that the price of QFT will rise in the long run, even if the demand from existing Questfall users who want to get an edge on the platform remains constant.

{% hint style="info" %}
This makes QFT tokenomics very different from any non-deflationary approach, which is essentially a Ponzi scheme, as existing holders can only cash out at the expense of many newcomers.
{% endhint %}

As the price of Credits is fixed in dollars, the increase (or decrease) in the price of QFT will not affect third-party projects promoting their quests to the Questfall audience. If someone wants to spend stablecoins on promotion, he will get the same number of Credits regardless of the price of QFT.

Furthermore, at times when the price of QFT falls, the number of tokens burned by third-party projects will increase, as more QFTs must be burned to obtain the same number of Credits. This leads to a rapid trend reversal as the shrinking of the circulating supply accelerates.

The QFT price changes will only affect miners and holders, who will receive a different number of Credits for their QFTs. As the price of QFT tends to rise in the long term, the number of Credits for a QFT token will increase over time.&#x20;

This is exactly how deflation works - the longer a consumer waits, the more value he will receive for the same amount of money.

{% hint style="info" %}
Although Worren Buffet said that "the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient", in reality this does not work. Deflationary tokenomics is the only way to implement a system in which those who wait earn.
{% endhint %}

And of course, this approach leaves the core mining advantage intact - the increase in the QFT price due to the influx of new money from investors will make mining more profitable, attracting new users and thus making QFT more attractive to investors, creating a positive feedback loop.
