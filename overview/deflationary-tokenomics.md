# Deflationary tokenomics

While the mining approach has worked very well in Bitcoin so far, it has a major problem in the long run. This problem is the imbalance between the value held by holders and the value received by miners - the ratio of BTCs received by miners to BTCs in circulation decreases over time.

When the Bitcoin blockchain started, each reward for a block gave miners a tangible share of the circulating supply, but today there are almost 20 million bitcoins in circulation and the remaining 1 million+ tokens will be mined over the next 125 years. This means that miners get a smaller and smaller share of the circulating supply, and since they are rewarded by issuing BTCs that gain value by taking it away from existing holders, their share of Bitcoin's capitalisation shrinks over time.

This could be compared to the finances of a company in the real world, and how income is divided between salaries for employees and dividends for shareholders. The simplistic mining mechanism implemented in Bitcoin assumes that dividends as a percentage of total company income will grow steadily over time until it reaches 100%. Not only does this seem unfair, but it is also dangerous for the system, as workers will eventually not earn enough.

In Bitcoin, it is assumed that once BTC issuance stops, miners will get their reward from transaction fees, but it will be a very different mechanism, and nobody knows in advance whether it will work or not.

Deflationary tokenomics solves this problem, as burning tokens reduces the circulating supply while increasing the miners' share. But burning without compensation results in losses and therefore only makes sense for altruists who benefit others at the expense of their own interests. Therefore, to make burning tokens attractive, users must receive some value from the system in return.

In Questfall, users who burn Questfall Tokens (QFT) receive Credits at a fixed price of $1, which can be used to gain benefits on the platform: authors can promote their quests, and users can level up faster. Another way for users to gain an advantage is to mint a Mining NFT for QFTs, which will also be burned by the system.

In this way, QFT tokens are issued each week to reward miners, while at the same time they are burned for Credits and NFTs. This dialectic has several advantages.

Firstly, it solves the inherent problem of bitcoin's approach to mining, as the miners' share of the system's capitalisation tends to be stable over the long term. In other words, the portion of QFT's capitalisation that is used to reward miners will not decrease despite the decline in token issuance.

The defaltionary nature of QFT also implies that the number of tokens in circulation will initially increase as there are no tokens to begin with, but as the market saturates, the number of QFTs in circulation will slowly decrease over time. This means that the price of QFT will rise in the long run, even if the demand from existing Questfall users who want to get an edge on the platform remains constant.

This makes QFT tokenomics very different from any non-deflationary approach, which is essentially a Ponzi scheme, as existing holders can only cash out at the expense of newcomers.

Thanks to the Credits concept, the increase (or decrease) in the price of QFT will not affect third-party projects that promote their quests to the Questfall audience, as the Credits required to do so have a fixed price in dollars. So if someone wants to spend some stablecoins on promotion, he will get the same number of Credits regardless of the price of QFT.

Furthermore, at times when the price of QFT falls, the number of tokens burned by third-party projects will increase, as more QFTs must be burned to obtain the same number of Credits. This leads to a rapid trend reversal due to a shrinking circulating supply.

The QFT price changes will only affect miners and holders, who will receive a different number of Credits for their QFTs. As the price of QFT tends to rise in the long term, the number of Credits (and therefore the value that can be obtained from the system) for a QFT token will increase over time. This is exactly how deflation works - the longer a consumer waits, the more value he will receive for the same amount of money.

Although Worren Buffet said that "the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient", in reality this is not true. Deflationary tokenomics is the only way to implement a system in which those who wait earn.

And of course, this approach leaves the core mining advantage intact - the increase in the QFT price due to the influx of new money from investors will make mining more profitable, thus attracting new users to quest activity and infrastructure support, resulting in Questfall's popularisation. And the more popular Questfall becomes, the more investors will be interested in QFT, creating a positive feedback loop.
