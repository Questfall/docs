# RPG gamification

The main advantage of deflation is also its main weakness. While on the one hand deflation makes any asset a good investment because of its potential rise, on the other hand it forces up the real cost when prices are denominated in the rising currency.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
This can be clearly seen in the examples of BTC or ETH - as the price of blockchain cryptocurrencies rises, the fees denominated in them become very expensive in dollars.
{% endhint %}

To overcome this problem, it is a good idea to use another token for pricing. The token that does not fluctuate much, so the real cost is constant in the long run.

For this reason, Questfall uses Credits (a dollar-based in-game currency), which are burned when users pay into the system for mining bonuses or quest promotions. As a result, system prices are set in dollars and are independent of the QFT price.

However, this introduces another problem: since QFT tokens are burned when Credits are deposited, there is nothing left on the chain to be returned in exchange for Credits when a user wants to withdraw them. In other words, there is no liquidity pool to back up user withdrawals.

{% hint style="info" %}
Stablecoin liquidity pools, which are typically used to support withdrawals, create demand for stablecoins themselves, adding value to them rather than the system. Such pools are also a prime target for hackers. And if a hacker successfully drains such a pool, the in-game assets become worthless.
{% endhint %}

In Questfall, the problem of taking value directly out of the system is solved by trading rather than liquidity pools. In other words, if Alice wants to add value to the system, she has to pay Bob, who wants to take value out of the system.&#x20;

And for this approach to work, there should be assets that can be transferred between the Questfall server and the blockchain in both directions. Furthermore, these assets should be tradable on both sides: with Credits on the server and with QFT on the chain.

And this is where the RPG system comes in.

{% hint style="info" %}
While this article focuses primarily on extracting value from the system through assets, we want to emphasise that the RPG approach in itself adds engagement by creating many possible strategies in addition to the basic one (complete as many quests as possible).
