# ðŸ’¸ QFT deflation

While the mining approach has worked very well in Bitcoin so far, it has a major problem in the long run. This problem is the imbalance between the value held by holders and the value received by miners - the ratio of BTCs in circulation to BTCs received by miners increases over time.

When the bitcoin blockchain started, each reward for a block gave miners a tangible share of the circulating supply, but today there are almost 20 million bitcoins in circulation and the remaining 1 million+ tokens will be mined over the next 125 years. This means that miners get a smaller and smaller share of the circulating supply, and since they are rewarded by issuing BTCs, which gain value by taking it away from existing holders, their share of the pie shrinks over time.

This could be compared to real-world company finances and how they are shared between workers as salaries and shareholders as dividends. The simplistic mining mechanism implemented in bitcoin assumes that dividends as a percentage of total company income will grow steadily over time until it reaches 100% in 2140. Not only does this seem unfair, but it is also dangerous for the system, as workers will eventually not earn enough.

In bitcoin, it is assumed that once bitcoin issuance stops, miners will get their reward from transaction fees, but it will be a very different mechanism, and nobody knows in advance whether it will work or not.

Deflationary tokenomics solves this problem, as burning tokens reduces the circulating supply while increasing the miners' share. But burning without compensation results in losses and therefore only makes sense for altruists who benefit others at the expense of their own interests. Therefore, to make burning tokens attractive, users must receive some value from the system in return.

In Questfall, users who burn Questfall Tokens (QFT) receive Credits at a fixed price of $1. These Credits in turn can be burned by authors to promote their quests, or by users to gain humanity without completing challenges. In this way, QFT tokens are issued each week as a reward to miners, while at the same time being burned for Credits. This dialectic has several advantages.

1. Mining's share of system capitalization tends to be stable over the long term. This means that the percentage of the increase in circulating supply from mining will be more or less constant from year to year, which means that the miner's income will also increase as more money comes in, despite the declining QFT issue.
2. The increase in the QFT price due to the influx of new money from investors makes mining more profitable, thus attracting new users to quest activity and infrastructure support.
3. The supply of QFT tokens in circulation will initially increase, as there will be no QFT tokens to begin with, but as the market saturates, the number of QFT tokens in circulation will slowly decrease over time. This means that the price of QFT will rise in the long run, even if the demand from existing Questfall users who want to get an edge on the platform remains constant. This makes QFT tokenomics very different from any non-deflationary approach, which is essentially a Ponzi scheme, as existing holders can only cash out at the expense of newcomers.
4. The volatility of the QFT price does not affect third-party projects that want to promote their quests to the Questfall audience, as the Credits needed to do so have a fixed price in dollars. So, if someone wants to spend some stablecoins on promotion, they will get the same number of Credits regardless of the price of QFT. The QFT price changes will only affect miners, who will receive a different number of Credits for their QFTs.
5. As the price of QFT tends to rise in the long term, the number of Credits (and therefore the value that can be obtained from the system) for a QFT token will increase over time. This is exactly how deflation works - the longer consumers wait, the more value they will receive for the same amount of money.
6. As the price of QFT falls, the number of tokens burned will increase, as more QFTs will have to be burned to obtain the same number of Credits. This leads to a rapid trend reversal due to a shrinking circulating supply.

In summary, deflationary tokenomics is not just a fix for the mining approach - it is a much healthier and fairer system, based on the idea that those who wait, earn. But for tokens to burn there should be some value that the system provides, in the case of Questfall it is an engaged and active audience of quest miners.
