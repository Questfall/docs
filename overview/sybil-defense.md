# ðŸŽ­ Sybil defense

One of the most important achievements of human civilization has been to resolve conflicts without bloodshed. In the vast majority of cases, this is achieved through the involvement of an outside authority whose decision is accepted by both sides of the conflict as the source of truth. It could be a court, a mafia patron, a boss or a priest.

In the absence of such authority, only fear can prevent the parties from resorting to violence, as was the case during the Cold War.

While scientists were working hard on the consensus problem, bitcoin became the first practical solution where the authority to resolve conflicts became a network of peer nodes. This was the first time in history that authority was a decentralized system, where the source of truth was the consensus of the majority, where everyone could try to defend their own interests at the expense of their computing power.

The Proof of Work is intended to be the source of truth on a single matter - which chain is canonical. And the consensus is achieved through voting, where each vote has different weight depending on the hash power of the node. This prevents Sybil attacks since vote weights are limited by the computational power of the participants, so splitting the weight to different votes does not add anything to an attacker. This way by limiting the real-world resources of the users Sybil attacks evolved to 51% attack in Bitcoin. Which means that if someone wants to be a source of truth, he needs to use more resources than everybody else in total.&#x20;

In Questfall there will be many matters on which there will be need for a source of truth provided by the community consensus, such as: whether the challenge is good, is the quest appropriate, is the completion of the quest faked or not and so on.

The decision on every particular question will be achieved through Proof of Humanity consensus, which is built upon two aspects.
