# ðŸŽ­ Sybil defense

One of the most important achievements of human civilization has been to resolve conflicts without bloodshed. In the vast majority of cases, this is achieved through the involvement of an outside authority whose decision is accepted by both sides of the conflict as the source of truth. It could be a court, a mafia patron, a boss or a priest.

In the absence of such authority, only fear can prevent the parties from resorting to violence, as was the case during the Cold War.

While scientists were working hard on the consensus problem, bitcoin became the first practical solution where the authority to resolve conflicts became a network of peer nodes. This was the first time in history that authority was a decentralized system, where the source of truth was the consensus of the majority, where everyone could try to defend their own interests at the expense of their computing power.

The Proof of Work is intended to be the source of truth on a single matter - which chain is canonical. And the consensus is achieved through voting, where each vote has different weight depending on the hash power of the node. This prevents Sybil attacks since vote weights are limited by the computational power of the participants, so splitting the weight to different votes does not add anything to an attacker. This way by limiting the real-world resources of the users Sybil attacks evolved to 51% attack in Bitcoin. Which means that if someone wants to be a source of truth, he needs to use more resources than everybody else in total.&#x20;

In Questfall there will be many matters on which there will be need for a source of truth, such as: whether the challenge is good, is the quest appropriate, is the completion of the quest faked and so on. The decision on every particular question will be achieved through the community consensus that we called Proof of Humanity, which is built upon three main concepts.

First, the humanity that is earned through challenges is a real-world limitation, that can't be faked (at least at a large scale). So, while achieving consensus users will spend humanity, but in return users that do not cheat will earn experience that will allow them to level up. This makes cheating a losing strategy while the majority obey the rules.

Second, the voting is not about gathering personal opinions on the matter. The voting is about trying to guess what the majority will think. We call this approach "average voting". Let's say a user liked the quest, and in every other case will give it 10 out 10. But the reward will depend on how far the rate will be from the average at the end of the voting. So, if a user wants to earn more, he will vote not for his opinion, but for his estimation on how others will vote.

Third, by proper voting when a user is close to the average that majority voted for, a voter receives experience, which helps than to level up in RPG style. Levels influence two major aspects. The higher is the level, the more a user will earn through mining, as the level will be a multiplier for calculating quest power. Also, levels will give more weight when voting.

The consensus based on the voting that uses such principles allows not only to prevent Sybil attacks but even 51% attack. The users will spend humanity for participating in consensus and the decision on each case will be very influenced by high-level users. Which means that to abuse the system a cheater should first earn humanity, then reject to spend it on mining in favor of consensus, then he needs to vote as the majority of top users to obtain experience to level up, and then when he has high level, he will compete with other high levels losing his achievements when he loses, while he could earn through mining.

This is the same as putting every penny earned with Bitcoin mining into ASIC farm and hoping that one day it will have hash power enough for 51% attack which allows to entirely rewrite the Bitcoin blockchain.



Sybil attack change the voting results through fake votes when they are easy to fake.

Humanity could not be bought as hash power in Bitcoin.
