  or promote it.

# üîù Quest promotion

With the global quest feed, the platform can influence the visibility of quests. The most popular quests will either be those that are highly rated by those who have completed them, or promoted quests that have brought value to the entire community by burning QFT (through Credits).

Quest promotion is not just about getting a certain spot in the global feed for a payment. All quests reward users with the same (default) amount of Mining Points. Promoting a quest means that an author adds a multiplier to this default amount by burning Credits. The more Credits burned, the higher the multiplier. This means that promoted quests are not only more visible, but also more attractive to mine.

This makes quests that do not add value to the community less popular, allowing users to focus on quests that are educational, fun, or offer a higher reward.
