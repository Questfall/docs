# ðŸŒ² Real-world quests

The mining approach assumes that value is added to the system independently by burning or holding. This makes the rewards truly global in the sense that the mining rewards are not biased, and users are paid by the system itself, not by projects or other users.

This means that anyone can use Questfall not only to make money but also a world a better place. The only requirement for such a quest is to be appreciated by the community. For example, our Team will create the ongoing "Plant a tree" quest right from the start.

Yes, we know that most oxygen is produced by seaweed, so our second quest of this type would be "Clean the Ocean".
{% endhint %}

However, there is a downside to this approach: since quests are not pre-moderated, they can be used for evil purposes. For example, quests such as 'Kill an animal' or 'Say nasty things about this company' may appear.

To prevent potential harm to others, any user can complain about a particular quest, and if there are enough complaints, the matter will be referred to community moderation. If the community decides that the complaints are not justified, the complainants will be punished by reducing their humanity, otherwise the quest will be blocked, and the complainants will receive a humanity bonus.
