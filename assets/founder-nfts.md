# - Founder NFTs

Founder NFTs represent a contribution to the platform's early development and help to raise the funds needed to build and promote Questfall.

Each Founder NFT is tied to a share of the 2,000,000 total [Founder Points](../infrastructure/founders-revenue.md). Holders of the NFT earn a percentage of the newly created QFTs each week, proportional to their founder points share. The earned QFTs accumulate on the Questfall platform from where they can be claimed.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the beginning, all the NFT holders will receive 95% of the total weekly issuance of QFT and this will decrease in stages to 10% with the development of Questfall and the creation of new [Pools](../overview/quest-mining.md).
{% endhint %}

In addition to an indefinite passive income source of 10% of the weekly QFT issuance, the Founder NFT will give the power to influence the project via Founders Club and give in-game benefits such as [Limited Edition Loot Boxes](./limited%20edition%20loot%20boxes.md) and free Silver.

### Initial Funding Event


The Founder NFTs are sold through the Initial Funding Event.
