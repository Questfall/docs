# - Founder NFTs

Founder NFTs represent a contribution to the platform's early development and help to raise the funds needed to build and promote Questfall.

Each Founder NFT is tied to a share of the 2,000,000 total [Founder Points](../infrastructure/founders-revenue.md). Holders of the NFT earn a percentage of the newly created QFTs each week, proportional to their founder points share. The earned QFTs accumulate on the Questfall platform from where they can be claimed.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the beginning, all the NFT holders will receive 95% of the total weekly issuance of QFT and this will decrease in stages to 10% with the development of Questfall and the creation of new [Pools](../overview/quest-mining.md).
{% endhint %}

In addition to an indefinite passive income source of 10% of the weekly QFT issuance, the Founder NFT will give the power to influence the project via Founders Club and give in-game benefits such as [Limited Edition Loot Boxes](./limited%20edition%20loot%20boxes.md) and free Silver.

### Initial Funding Event


At **Initial Funding Event** the users can purchase Founder NFTs of six tiers containing different amounts of founder points. With each tier, the cost of NFT gets higher but the actual price of one founder point decreases. The prices of the NFTs ranges from 10 dollars (F) to $2430 (A). 

With each purchase, the user receives 10 Limited Edition Loot Boxes containing items of the tier of the NFT.

The Founder NFTs are in sale until all the 1.2M founder points are sold.
