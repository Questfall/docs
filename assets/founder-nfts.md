# Founder NFTs

Founder NFTs represent a contribution to the platform's early development and help to raise the funds needed to build and promote Questfall. The first holders of the Founder NFTs can be seen as the initial miners as they will get the early circulating supply of QFT before the platform's launch.

Each Founder NFT is tied to a share of the 2,500,000 total [Founder Points](../infrastructure/founders-revenue.md). Holders of the NFT earn a percentage of the newly created QFTs each week, proportional to their founder points share. The earned QFTs accumulate on the Questfall platform from where they can be claimed.

For multiple months all the NFT holders will receive 95% of the total weekly issuance of QFT and this will decrease in stages to 10% with the development of pools and the launch of Questfall.

{% hint style="info" %}
Pre-launch of Questfall 11% of the weekly issuance will go to NFT burning, QFT freezing, and liquidity pool. With the launch of Questfall, 66% will go to miners, and authors, and 8% to Gold withdrawals.
{% endhint %}

In addition to an indefinite passive income source of 10% of the weekly QFT issuance, all the NFTs will offer in-game benefits in the form of loot boxes, Gold, and Silver. Also, the C, B, and A tier Founder NFTs will give the power to influence the project via the Founders Club.

### Initial Funding Event

At **Initial Funding Event** the users can purchase Founder NFTs of six tiers containing different amounts of founder points. With each tier, the cost of NFT gets higher but the actual price of one founder point decreases. The prices of the NFTs range from 10 dollars (F) to $2430 (A).

With each NFT, the user receives one [Limited Edition Loot Box](broken-reference) containing an item of the same tier as the NFT. Additionally, the user gets a normal loot box and free Silver and Gold with each NFT purchase.

There is a limited number of each tier of Founder NFT in sale. The IFE will last a few days or until all the NFTs and 1.8 million founder points are sold.
