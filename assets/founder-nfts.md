# Founder NFTs

Owners of Founder NFTs will receive an unlimited revenue stream from the platform for their contribution to the early development and promotion of Questfall. They are the only participants who will receive a portion (10%) of the weekly QFT issue forever for adding one-time value, as all other users must add value each week to receive another reward.

There are six rarity tiers of Founder NFTs, each of which contains a fixed amount of Founder Points that are used as the basis for QFT distribution each week.

The 10% portion of the weekly QFT issuance will be distributed to all Founder NFT holders based on their share of Founder Points. Depending on the amount of NFTs minted by the public, there can be a maximum of 2,602,200 Founder Points. However, as the number of Founder NFTs decreases over time, the share of the remaining holders will increase.

{% hint style="info" %}
Founder NFTs are a deflationary asset backed by a deflationary QFT. As such, we believe it is the best long-term investment vehicle in the market and will not be selling our NFTs for the foreseeable future. In fact, we see them as a good legacy for our grandchildren.
{% endhint %}

The QFT reward is accrued for the particular NFT, and to get actual tokens in the wallet, founders must claim them. There is no need to claim the reward each week as the rewarded tokens accumulate and can be claimed all at once.&#x20;

The need to claim rewarded QFTs means that the tokens are not actually issued until they are in the founder's wallet.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Unclaimed tokens are sold or burned along with the Founder NFT.
{% endhint %}

During the first 50 weeks (almost a year), each owner of a Founder NFT will receive a certain amount of Gold and Silver. However, if the NFT changes hands, the Gold and Silver for the following weeks will go to the new owner of the NFT.

As a result, the price of Founder NFTs in the secondary market should include the value of Gold and Silver to be released in the future.

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition to the Founders Club,  Gold and Silver compensation, IFE participants will receive other bonuses, but they are tied to the wallet address, not the NFT. [Learn more](../roadmap/initial-funding-event.md).
