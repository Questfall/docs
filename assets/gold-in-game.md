# - Gold (off-chain)

Xp points are used solely for creating quests on the platform. They cannot be traded or exchanged. \
Each Creator account will come with 10.000 preloaded XP points for the duration of the Genesis launch event(2-3 months maybe?)\
\
How to obtain XP points?\
1\. Buy XP points with QFT tokens or stable coins(stable coins will be automatically converted to QFT at market price and added to the Reward Pool distribution)\
2\. Top-quality creators will share a % of the distributed QFT which in return can be exchanged for XP  assuring quality creators can use the platform for free



Distribution of XP points to users\
1\. Completing Binary quests\
&#x20;  The base XP distribution in this case is the same for all users completing the quest. \
2\. Completing Quality quests\
&#x20;   The base XP distribution in this case is based on the individual quest leaderboard rank.\
\
Note: The base XP is multiplied by Miners NFT, Staking and Levels before the weekly checkpoint and recieve QFT based on the final multiplied XP number\
Example: I collect 1000 base XP points during the week. They will be multiplied by Staking + Miners NFT. 1000 x (100% + 100%)\
(Are we still using the Levels as multipliers?) I don't remember the final decision\
\
\
Leveling up with XP points\
Only base XP points are used to level up. Multipliers are not considered.\
