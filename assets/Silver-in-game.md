# Silver (in-game)

Silver is an in-game currency that is managed by the Questfall servers, not the blockchain. The main idea behind Silver is to equalize people who want to pay for system bonuses with money and those who want to add value to the system with their activity.

On the one hand, those who have enough money and value their time can buy Silver by burning QFT -> Gold -> Silver, bringing value to the entire community.

On the other hand, those who find leveling up or quest promotion through burning QFT too expensive can earn Silver directly by voting the right way in the moderation, which also adds value to the community.

Silver is debited as a reward for moderation, but it can also be credited as a penalty for bad voting. And since new users can make mistakes when they first start moderating, their Silver balance can go negative.

However, to prevent bot testing and moderation parsing, there is a limit of -5,000 Silver where a user will be banned for 24 hours. This way, every time the negative Silver balance decreases by -5,000 Silver, a user will be banned for one day.

Since the reward for proper moderation is a leveling opportunity, not a token, the Silver cannot be withdrawn or traded. It can only be used to pay into the system for XP and a quest's Base Reward, or to donate to a particular author's space.

As a result, Silver is a crucial part of the inner balance of Questfall. It's used not only to balance the interests of the whales and the common users, but also as part of the Sybil defense.
