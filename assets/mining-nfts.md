# âš¡ Miners NFT

Miners NFTs are used by users to increase their mining power on the platform. \
They come in 4 tiers:\
1\. Platinium 100% extra mining power\
2\. Gold 75%\
3\. Silver 50%\
4\. Bronze 25%\
\
How it works(imo)\
Only 1 NFT can be locked at the same time to receive the bonus or 1 of each type maybe?\
This can increase the demand for each tier but will greatly increase the multiplier

The NFT needs to be locked to receive the extra mining power. \
Upon locking the NFT, the bonus is received instantly.\
The cool down period after unlock is 7 days and the bonus is not received during this time( needed to prevent abuse)\
\
\
How to obtain Miners NFTs?\
1\. Buying a minimum amount of Founders NFTs(power points) will give miners NFTs as a bonus. \
2\. Participating early in the project \
