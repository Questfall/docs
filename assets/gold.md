Gold is an in-game currency that is used as the primary means of payment in the system, as well as a means of value exchange between in-game and on-chain.

When a user burns QFT, the price for Gold is taken from the official QFT swap pool and the system deposits the required amount of Gold into the user's account based on the price of QFT in stablecoins in the pool.

Gold allows users to receive all the benefits of the system directly or through the Silver, and since the only way to issue Gold is to burn QFT, it adds value to the entire community. Also, since the price of Gold is set in dollars, users will receive the same amount of Gold for their stablecoins regardless of the price of QFT.

Gold opens the door to user strategies other than direct Quest Mining, as it can be used to extract value from the system. Users can craft items to earn Gold and then withdraw it from the system via the auction, or craft items of higher rarity using items purchased on the marketplace with Gold and then sell them for QFT.&#x20;

This allows merchants and crafters to earn QFT by providing the necessary equipment to actual miners, making Questfall more complex and engaging.
