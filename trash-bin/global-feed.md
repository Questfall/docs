# ðŸ“° Global feed

Existing quest platforms either have no tokenomics at all, or very weak tokenomics, so it is assumed that users receive rewards from the particular projects they do quests for. This approach not only makes user rewards arbitrary and optional, but also makes it pointless to spread effort across quests from different projects.

A mining approach accompanied by deflationary tokenonimcs on the one hand allows users to mine quests from any project thanks to the global rewards, and on the other hand the amount of QFT teams will be willing to burn to promote their quests depends strictly on the size of the userbase. These two aspects make the global quest feed not just a feature, but a necessity.

The global quest feed is the direct analogue to the post feed in any social media platform. Not only does it allow users to keep up with what is happening on Questfall, but it also helps projects to promote their quests to all users of the platform at once.

This makes Questfall similar to any social media site like Facebook or Tweeter. The only difference is the depth of user interaction with the content. If the social media format does not require a mandatory response to the post, a quest will need some proof that a user has taken a certain action.

#### Reward for quest quality

Most of the projects on the existing quest platforms do not put a lot of resources into creating quests, and as a result, most of them are dumb tasks like joining Discord or reposting a Tweet. This happens because projects are primarily interested in promoting themselves, and quest platforms give them access to the userbase without any demands on the quality of the quests, which require a lot of effort. So, project teams simply take the most efficient route.

Thanks to the mining approach, Questfall is able to reward authors for the quality of their quests. To do this, every user will be forced to vote on the quest's quality rating after completing the quest. This rating will be used to calculate the reward for the quest author - the more the public rates the quest, the higher the reward for the author.

In this way, authors who create content that is highly valued by the community will be rewarded for doing so. In other words, authors will be able to be rewarded for publishing their books, articles, lessons, music, images, videos and so on. Quests such as 'Read the new chapter of my book and answer the question' could become a new paradigm for making money from the creation of intellectual products in today's economy.

#### Quest promotion

With the global quest feed, the platform can influence the visibility of quests. The most popular quests will either be those that are highly rated by those who have completed them or promoted quests that have brought value to the entire community by burning QFT (through Credits).

Quest promotion is not just about getting a certain spot in the global feed for a payment. All quests reward users with the same (default) amount of Mining Points. Promoting a quest means that an author adds a multiplier to this default amount by burning Credits. The more Credits burned, the higher the multiplier. This means that promoted quests are not only more visible, but also more attractive to mine.

This makes quests that do not add value to the community less popular, allowing users to focus on quests that are educational, fun, or offer a higher reward.

#### Real-world quests

The mining approach assumes that value is added to the system independently by burning or holding. This makes the rewards truly global in the sense that the mining rewards are not biased, and users are paid by the system itself, not by projects or other users.

This means that anyone can use Questfall not only to make money but also a world a better place. The only requirement for such a quest is to be appreciated by the community. For example, our Team will create the ongoing 'Plant a tree' quest right from the start.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since most oxygen is produced by algae, our second quest of this type would be 'Clean the Ocean'.
{% endhint %}

However, there is a downside to this approach: since quests are not pre-moderated, they can be used for evil purposes. For example, quests such as 'Kill an animal' or 'Say nasty things about this company' may appear.

To prevent potential harm to others, any user can complain about a particular quest, and if there are enough complaints, the matter will be referred to community moderation. If the community decides that the complaints are not justified, the complainants will be punished by reducing their humanity, otherwise the quest will be blocked, and the complainants will receive a humanity bonus.
