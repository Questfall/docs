For a solid defense against Sybil attacks, the number of challenges in the system should be sufficient in relation to the total number of users. To achieve this, any user can create a challenge, which becomes active once it has been approved by the community. The system will distribute 2% of the newly created QFTs each week to reward authors whose challenges are accepted during that week.

Also, users should be motivated to create interesting and engaging challenges. To maintain quality, an additional 4% of the newly created QFTs will be distributed each week to authors who created challenges in previous weeks, based on the ranking of their challenges.

As the user vote is not applied to the challenge rating until the user's completion of the challenge has been approved by the community, bots and multi-accounts will not be able to abuse the challenge rating.

To keep the system self-cleaning, 5% of the lowest rated challenges will be removed each week. This means that authors who create high quality challenges will continue to earn passive income for an unlimited period of time, while low quality challenges will be removed, and their authors will no longer receive weekly rewards.
