## Loot boxes

**Loot boxes** are the primary source of all **RPG items**. They can be obtained by buying directly from the system for **100 gold** (1$) each or by collecting a full set of **chest shards**. Chest shards can be earned by completing quests.

{% hint style="info" %}
The gold spent on buying loot boxes is automatically burned by the system.
{% endhint %}

By default, a loot box provides one item, with the chance of it being any type, tier, or level. Users can increase their chances of receiving more items by placing points in the Luck attribute. 

For more details about the function of **chest shards** and **luck attribute** see the [character section](character.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
Loot boxes are the only way new items are released into circulation. 
{% endhint %}

The function of a loot box is closer to in-game gold than items:

*  Loot boxes do not influence the carried weight or stamina consumption
*  There is no upper limit to how many loot boxes can be bought or carried
*  Loot boxes can be stored indefinitely and be opened at any time without using essence

There are a few limitations regarding loot boxes:

*  They can’t be traded with other users
*  Loot box can’t be opened if the character weight limit is fully used
