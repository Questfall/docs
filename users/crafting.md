# Crafting

Crafting allows users to upgrade items with essence and disassemble items for essence.

This creates an additional layer of game mechanics and gives users the ability to get an edge by advancing their equipment. Crafting adds value to all types of items in Questfall as any item can be disassembled and used as a source of essence.

### Item weight

The item's weight, amount of essence it contains, and tier and level are directly correlated. The heavier the item the more essence is needed for upgrading it. By disassembling an item user gets a percentage of the essence it contains.
For more details see the [essence balance](character.md)

Essence is a highly valued resource as in addition to crafting it is needed to equip and unequip clothing and spell books and it canâ€™t be bought or traded.

The crafting efficiency can be increased by adding points to the crafting attribute.

### Item Crafting

The amount of boosts an item gives depends on its tier and level which can be upgraded by crafting.

All types of clothing, elixirs, and spellbooks can be evolved to a higher tier and clothes can be also leveled up.

#### Clothing

Users can freely choose to upgrade either the tier or level of clothing. Any level item can be evolved by tier and any tier item can be increased in level. The cost/benefit ratio is the same with both upgrades but evolving the tier often consumes more essence at one time as it has a greater effect on item bonuses. 

* **The tier upgrade** adds randomly a new effect to the clothing and the item level stays the same. When the item gets a new upgradable effect (F -> E, E -> D), the power of the new effect is based on the clothing level.

{% hint style="info" %}
For example A level 20 common (F) helmet gives +2% to mining efficiency, and by evolving it to Advanced (E), it will give +2% to mining efficiency and +10 to mana. (+0.5 mana for each level)
{% endhint %}

* **The level upgrade** linearly increases the effect of all the upgradable bonuses within the clothing. All the non-upgradable bonuses stay the same. 

{% hint style="info" %}
For example A level 10 rare (D) robe gives +1% to mining efficiency, +5 to mana, and +5 stamina, by upgrading it to level 11 it gives 1.1% to mining efficiency, +5.5 to mana, and +5.5 to stamina. 
{% endhint %}

All tier of clothing has upgradeable effects and the higher tier also has non-upgradable effects. The number of upgradable and non-upgradable effects is based on the tier:

*  1/0 - Common (F) 	
*  2/0 - Advanced (E) 	
*  3/0 - Rare (D) 	
*  3/1 - Legendary (C) 	
*  3/2 - Epic (B) 	
*  3/3 - Mythic (A) 	


#### Elixirs

The tier of elixirs can be evolved with essence.

#### Spellbooks

The tier of spellbook effects the power of the spell.
Five spellbooks of the same type and tier can be crafted into one book of the next tier.
