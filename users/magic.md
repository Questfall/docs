# Magic

Users can use spells to gain advantages when using the platform. There are 4 dedicated spell slots that open with progression in character levels.\
\
Books can be found in lootboxes and can be traded on the marketplace. \
\
In Questfall, to learn a spell a Book is required. \
There are 6 tiers of rarity for spellbooks\
\
1\. Common(F)\
2\. Advanced or Refined(E)\
3\. Rare (D)\
4\. Legendary (C)\
5\. Epic (B)\
6\. Mythic(A)\
\
To upgrade books, users need to merge 5 books of the same type and rarity. For example, 5 common books with the same spell can merged to create an Advanced book of the same spell. This means that the rarity tier will increase same as the spell's power\
\
When learning a spell the book is consumed forever and cannot be sold back. Spells can be unlearned by simply deleting them. \
\
Intelligence is the main attribute for spells. It increases the number of spells a user can learn and the number of active spells available. \
\
Spells consume Mana. The more powerful the spell, the more mana it consumes.\
Mana is a limited resource used to cast spells. It regenerates slowly after some time. Mana capacity and regeneration can be increased by putting skill points in character attributes or by equipping certain items.\
