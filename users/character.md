# Character

In Questfall, as in most RPGs, each user is represented by a character, which is the user's avatar on the platform and evolves over time through quest mining, completion moderating, PvP fighting, spell casting, item crafting and trading.&#x20;

The system is designed to balance different character traits and system resources, requiring users to carefully manage their character's development according to their individual strategy. Here's an in-depth look at the key components that make up a character.

#### Character Level

One of the most important character parameters is level. While users start as a level 1 character, they can level up by acquiring XP either through proper moderation (by voting with the majority) or by paying directly with gold into the system.

A character's level is defined by two numbers: the level itself and the amount of XP required to advance to the next level. Although the level cannot be lowered, the amount of XP required to reach the next level can be increased if the user is penalized for going against the majority.&#x20;

For example, if the user votes against the majority on a particular quest completion, or if the user reports a quest that the community agrees is appropriate, and so on.
{% endhint %}

Leveling up provides several benefits to a user. As the level increases, so does the weight of a user's vote in community moderation decisions. Level also determines the league in which the user is placed, meaning that a higher-level user can mine with less competition. Finally, with each level, a user receives one free attribute point that can be used to upgrade the character.

#### Character Attributes

An attribute point, which is gained with each level, can be used to improve one of the character's six attributes:

* **Mining:** increases mining power, increases the stamina limit;
* **Inventory**: increases the weight limit of stored items;
* **Magic**: increases the mana limit, increases the number of spells in grimoire;
* **Regeneration**: increases the speed of mana and stamina replenishment;
* **Crafting**: increases the efficiency of essence usage, adds marketplace slots;
* **Luck**: increases the chances of getting different bonuses, adds cards in loot boxes.

Because users can allocate the points they earn to any attribute, they can focus on certain areas and gain specific advantages. This allows users to customize their character to suit their individual mining strategy. Of course, users can make mistakes as their characters develop, so when a user joins a new league, he can redistribute attribute points once for free. However, any subsequent redistribution within that league will cost _<mark style="background-color:blue;">100 \* LeagueNumber</mark>_ Gold.

#### Clothing Slots

Clothing items are the primary means by which users can improve their characters through the various effects that items contain, from increasing mining power to improving crafting efficiency.&#x20;

The number of clothing slots is limited to six for all users and cannot be increased individually:

* Head (helmets, hoods, hats);
* Chest (robes, tunics, shirts);
* Leg (pants, trousers);
* Feet (boots, shoes);
* Hand (gloves, gauntlets);
* Back (capes, cloaks, mantles).&#x20;

Although clothing items can be of different levels and rarities, there are no restrictions on equipping them other than type - obviously boots can't be equipped in the hand slot.

However, if the level of the item is higher than the user's level, it will be downgraded (while equipped) to the user's level. Additionally, stamina consumption rises as the total weight of equipped items increases.

#### Item Inventory

The inventory can hold any number of items (such as clothing, potions, elixirs, spellbooks), but there is a weight limit. If the inventory is overloaded, mana regeneration will stop until the weight of items in the inventory is below the limit.

Activity Score

Earned ACT points are used to distribute reward at the end of the week and at the end of the season. ACT can be thought of as a mining power, which reset each reward perdiod (one week for a regular mining and three month for seasons).
