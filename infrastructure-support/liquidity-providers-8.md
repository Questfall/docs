# ðŸ’° Liquidity providers (8%)

In order for investors to buy Questfall Tokens (QFT) or for miners to sell their QFTs without significant price influence, it is necessary to ensure sufficient liquidity. This will be achieved through the use of 8% of the newly created QFTs, which will be allocated each week to reward liquidity providers according to their average share in the pool during a week.

The reward will be paid only to those who provide liquidity to the official Uniswap QFT-USDT pool. This is crucial as the price of this official pool will be used by Questfall to determine the debiting number of [Credits ](../assets/credits-off-chain.md)when QFTs are burned.
